Subspecies aren't playable species in and of themselves; instead, they act as templates you can apply to existing species. They can be applied to any of the existing species, as long as your character's final Stats aren't reduced below 0.

See the example subspecies on the next page for a quick guide on how to use these templates.

Above all else, keep in mind that this is intended to easily put together unique concepts not covered by the base species; if a particular combination of species and subspecies doesn't work the way you'd like, or you think certain qualities should be available to your concept, try talking it over with your GM.

>
> ![](assets/images/species/sub/blessed.png)
> {: .float-right-desktop }
> Blessed creatures have the radiance of the stars themselves, whether it's inherited, earned or through some other twist of fate. Though rare, their presence brings great comfort to people around the world, and many have risen to greatness – though, to be sure, there's nothing inherently good in the Stars' blessings. They work in mysterious ways.

This affinity even extends to managing their finances, and seemingly conjuring treasure from thin air. All this contributes to a certain confidence that can make them hard to deal with, and blind to their own failings – but undeniably charismatic.
