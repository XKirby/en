A character's Species modifies their Stats, adds extra Skill Specialisations, and provides many other traits.

Then, you can choose one of those stats to receive another +1 boost, representing your character's unique personal qualities. | Assign your Skills All Skills fall under the umbrella of one Stat – for example, Athletics is a Heart Skill, while Notice is a Spirit Skill. During character creation, your Stats receive varying Skill Points and Skill Specialisations to further customise your character. a. Choose one Stat's Skills to receive +4 Skill Points and +2 Skill Specialisations. b. Then, choose a second Stat's Skills to receive +3 Skill Points and +1 Skill Specialisation. c. Finally, the remaining Stat's Skills receive +2 Skill Points and +1 Skill Specialisation. | Define your Skill Specialisations While Skills are broad general capabilities for your character, Specialisations are the specific things they excel in. Your Specialisations are up to you to define. You can even assign Specialisations to Skills you otherwise don't have any points in! But as a general rule, they shouldn't be so vague that they always apply, or so specific that they rarely make a difference. | Design your Techniques Your Techniques are the special moves that help your character excel in combat. Usually these are straightforward attacks, but you can customise them to be as complex as you wish. You begin play with two Techniques. It is recommended that you have at least one Technique that costs 0 FP, so that you always have a basic attack option. | Fill up your pockets Finally, you start with 100 Coins (or more or less, depending on your campaign) to spend on Items, Power-Ups, Gear and Badges. Items, Power-Ups and Gear of all sizes occupy one of your 10 inventory slots, while Badges are small enough to not take up space – but the Badges you can actually equip and use at the same time will be restricted by your BP. | . When you're choosing your skills, it's important to consider what the other players in your group can and can't do. That way when they run into trouble, you'll be ready to lend a helping hand . It's okay if your character concept isn't fully formed to begin with! As you read on you might find some interesting content that you want to work in, or during play you might pick up a Badge you hadn't considered working with. The joy of roleplay is finding new directions to take your character! . Don't stress too much about getting the right Items or Badges right out of the gate – you might find it easier to just jump in with nothing but the clothes on your back and the Coins in your pocket. You can always go shopping once you know what you're dealing with – or make do with what you can find! . ",

    "content": ". | First Strikes and Initiative | Free Actions and Reactions | Targeting | Damage and Knockouts | . Combat in Paper Story is largely abstract; allied characters act as a single group, arranging themselves in a front-to-back formation at the start of combat (either arranged as they wish, or dictated based on circumstance). Typically combats are between two groups, players and enemies. If players are fighting it out or enemies are split between factions, though, it can get more complicated and require more groups. During each round of combat, each player has a turn where they can take one action. Turns proceed through the group one-by-one, going from front to back. At the end of the players' turns, each enemy group takes their actions in sequence, until there are no more enemies and the next round of combat begins. ",

    "content": "Before most combats, all players have to roll Initiative to see how quickly they react – in other words, who gets a First Strike. Typically this check depends on Athletics, but Trickery, Notice or other checks may be more appropriate, depending on how the fight begins. Usually, all players act in the same group, but sometimes you might have multiple players working independently – or fighting it out. Whichever group of players gets the most Grades of Success collectively goes first; if all player groups are tied, then the GM has to make a decision. In any case, enemies never move ahead of the players. If a player gets a Great result, they can act in the Surprise Round, allowing them to use one Technique before turns are declared. Generally this free attack cannot target more than one enemy and cannot cost FP, but can target foes that would normally be out of range. On the other hand if a player fails their Initiative check, an enemy can make an attack against them in the Surprise Round, even if they would normally be out of range. However, the same enemy cannot make multiple attacks in the Surprise Round. The Surprise Round isn't counted as a full round, and while players can act during it and get to react to damage, this isn't considered a \"turn\" in the traditional sense. So Statuses and other durations aren't affected by the Surprise Round. ",

    "content": "Now if we put it all together, we can present an example of how a session works in Paper Story. For this example we'll be following the adventures of a group of three – Kelly the Koopa, Buster the Bob-Omb and Squinch the Squeek. GM: Okay gang, when we last left off you were lost in the wild jungle of Keelhaul Key. The sun is starting to set and your rations are just about gone. Any bright ideas? . SQUINCH: I remember I tried sniffing out the shore last time… that didn't work out. BUSTER: If we follow the sun we'll eventually reach the shore, right? . GM: That would work, but the jungle is very thick. You'd need some way to blitz through the underbrush. KELLY: Well my claws are pretty sharp, can't I just hack through? . GM: That would work, it'd be a messy job though. It sounds like an Athletics check to me. KELLY: Can I add my specialisation in Brute Force? . GM: Yeah, I can see that working, go for it. The rest of the team sit back and wait to see how Kelly handles things. Kelly rolls 2d6 for her Athletics, plus 1d6 for her Brute Force specialisation. She rolls a 5, a 3 and a 2; one Grade of Success. KELLY: Okay that's a Nice… I have three Heart, so I'll nudge my 3 into a 4 for another Success… I can nudge the 2 into a 4 as well but that would still only be Good, right? . GM: Yeah, Good is good though. So Kelly starts ripping and tearing, and pretty quickly you've established a path. She's making quite a bit of noise in the process. KELLY: Woo! . BUSTER: That noise is probably going to attract some trouble, though. Do we notice anything? . GM: Kelly's a little too into it to hear much of anything right now, but yeah, maybe you guys should make a Notice check . Buster and Squinch make their checks. Squinch includes his specialisation in Scent – normally he'd ask the GM, like Kelly did, but they've been doing this for a while and he pretty much always follows his nose. It's easier in this case for the GM to say when he can't use it instead. BUSTER: I've got a 4, and two 5's… If I nudge a 5 up to a 6 I can roll one more, that's a 2… I've got 2 Spirit left though so I can just nudge that up to a 4. All together that's 4 Successes, Great! . SQUINCH: 5 Successes for me, so Great too. GM: Very nice. Buster, you can hear something rustling around in the jungle that's not coming from Kelly's work… sounds like it's behind you. Squinch, you can smell the putrid too-ripe scent of poison plants. SQUINCH: Piranha Plants, maybe? . BUSTER: I'll quietly get Kelly's attention, we need some muscle. SQUINCH: I'm going to go ahead and hide myself if that's okay, I have a Stealth specialisation. GM: Yeah, we'll count that for your Initiative. A trio of slithering Putrid Piranhas burst out from the bushes behind you! Buster and Kelly I'll need Athletics from you, Squinch you can use your Trickery. The GM adds three small figurines to the table to represent the enemies. While the team rolls their Initiative checks, the GM looks over his notes on Putrid Piranhas. KELLY: Easy, I've got 2 for a… Good! Right? . SQUINCH: Yeah that's right. I've got 4, so Great! . BUSTER: Uhh, this isn't good. No successes from me. GM: Okay, so Squinch bursts out from another, smaller bush and gets his surprise attack! . Squinch attacks the lead plant with his basic attack, Sneak Attack. It has Piercing, Strong and Unwieldy, so it deals 2 DMG on a Nice result, and 4 DMG on a Good result. If the plants had Defense, he'd be able to bypass that with Piercing, too. SQUINCH: Alright, my Coordination was 3 Successes – so Good, for 4 damage. GM: That's a respectable hit, the plant reels in shock! However his buddy sees an opportunity to bite down, hard, on Buster! . BUSTER: Oh jeez, I'm really not the athletic type huh? I'll just try to block it with a Guard check I guess… 1, so just Nice. Plus my 1 Defense. The GM checks his notes, and sees that he's given Putrid Piranha's a 3 DMG attack with a three-turn Lingering (3) poison. If Buster suffers this poison he'll take another 3 damage at the end of the turn – but he knows Buster has a chance to respond. GM: Not quite enough, sorry Buster. You're able to deflect the bulk of it but you still take 1 damage, and its vile breath afflicts you with a Lingering poison! . BUSTER: I do have Steady at least, so I'm going to try and reduce it… wait, hold on, I'm a Bob-Omb. Aren't I immune to poison? . GM: Yeah sorry, you're right. Alright, that's First Strikes over, who's moving first? . KELLY: I'm the muscle here! I'll get in front. I dunno if it'll make much of a difference though if the plants can burrow past me. I'm not too distracted to go first, right? . GM: No you're fine, Buster got your attention before things got too heated. BUSTER: Do you still have that Power Punch, Squinch? . SQUINCH: Oh yeah! I'll go after Kelly then so I can use it on Buster. BUSTER: Great! I'll bring up the rear. Hopefully I can get a big enough boom to end the fight quickly. The players arrange their own figurines in a row on the table, and the GM moves the three Putrid Piranha figurines in front of them. GM: Okay then, Kelly to act. KELLY: Rip and tear! I'm going to claw that front guy with my Savage Slicer! . Kelly moves her figurine up in front of the enemy while she rolls to act out an attack – this isn't really necessary, but it helps her visualise the action. Savage Slicer is Kelly's strongest attack, costing 4 FP, which Kelly marks off her sheet before she rolls. The Technique has Indirect (representing Kelly's scaly armoured claws), Strong x2, Weaken (Defense) x2, Commitment (Primary) and Unwieldy. Adding it all together with Kelly's 1 Power, this gives her a Technique with 3 Power, that requires a Good Coordination check to deal damage, and can shake up enemy defenses with a secondary Bully check. Kelly's chosen to split the damage into two 3 DMG strikes, for 6 in total. KELLY: Oh yeah! That's Good! . The GM quickly checks his notes again and confirms the Putrid Piranhas have 8 HP; including the damage Squinch already dealt, Kelly's attack will easily finish off the first enemy. KELLY: Okay so, for the Bully check – . GM: No that's okay Kelly, you've torn through him just fine. With two mighty claw sweeps you scatter the plant's leaves to ribbon, and it slumps onto the ground, defeated. KELLY: Oh, okay. Woo! . The GM takes the figurine for the defeated plant off the table. GM: Squinch to act. SQUINCH: So Kelly obviously wasn't listening, but that's okay, we'll just go ahead with our plan. KELLY: Oh, sorry guys. Fights get me so heated! . BUSTER: Haha, we get it, you're fine. And now we know they've got something like 10 HP, and I can save some FP on my turn. SQUINCH: Yeah it's all good, we appreciate your moxie. So anyway, I'm going to hand Buster my Power Punch and boost him up. GM: Did you want to make a Heal check to improve that at all? . SQUINCH: On no dice? No I'll give that a miss, thanks. GM: Okay, that's fine. So you hand it off to Buster and he's able to chug it down, then suddenly doubles in size. Buster, your move. BUSTER: Fee, fi, fo, fum… Heh heh, I think the basic Boombast should do it here. Boombast is Buster's basic explosive attack, with Scaling, Indirect, Element (Blast), Variant (Athletics), Burst, Strong and Exhausting, Unwieldy. Because most of the FP cost is covered by his Bob-Omb Tech Defaults, he's able to reduce it down to 0 FP, but can't act during the next turn. The end result is an explosive attack that can hit both plants, dealing 4 DMG with a Nice, 6 DMG with a Good and 8 DMG with a Great. BUSTER: Come on, Athletics… No! That's just a Good. So 6 DMG. SQUINCH: +1 from your Attack. BUSTER: Yeah, thanks, that wasn't including the Attack boost, but I don't think 7 damage is going to cut it… I'd boost that up to a Great with SP, if I had any. GM: Yeah, unfortunately not – it's quite a powerful attack, though. The super-sized Buster explodes right in front of them! You deal 7 damage to the front plant, then 6 to the one behind it. BUSTER: Ah, I forgot about the Burst penalty too. GM: That's okay. So, the Putrid Piranhas are covered in soot and badly shaken up, but they're still aggressive and can see that Buster hasn't got another attack in him. So while the front one lashes out at Kelly in melee, the other burrows under and pops out behind her, chomping down on Buster! That's 3 damage to both of you – plus the poison, for Kelly. KELLY: I've got Defense too, so I'll Guard. That's a Great! So it goes down to 2 from my Defense, then I reduce it twice with blocking, so I won't take any poison. And I have an extra Grade of Success. Oh! I can Superguard, right? . GM: Yep, you're able to defend and pirouette into a shell strike. Their fangs bounce off your tough shell and they recoil in pain! You deal 1 more damage to the Putrid Piranha, and it slumps over, KO'd! . The GM takes another figurine off the table, leaving just one enemy. KELLY: Guys, they've got 8 HP! So the last one is barely standing. BUSTER: Yeah, I can't do much about it now though. I Guarded as well, but got nothing. GM: So your metal hide is a bit tougher, but the Piranha's desperate bite crunches down with force, dealing 2 damage to you. So, there's just one more enemy to fight, but it's looking pretty frightened. Next round, it's Kelly from the top, what do you do? . And that's the basics of play in Paper Story! . Now you're ready to get out there and explore the world yourself! The rest of the book goes into a lot more detail on specific skills and Items you might need to know about, but if you're eager to start, you can jump right into a game and look it up as you go! . ",

    "title": "The Stats",
    "content": "Characters in Paper Story all follow the same general rules. They all have three Stats, and a variety of Skills that fall under the umbrella of those stats. Heart – your Health Points and physical ability. Characters have 5 HP x their Heart – to a minimum of 1 HP. Spirit – your Flower Points and mental/technical ability. Characters have 5 FP x their Spirit. Courage – your Badge Points and spiritual/social ability. Characters have 3 BP x their Courage. In addition, players have some special stats used for combat, which aren't related to the main three stats. Power – your raw combat skill and capacity for dealing damage to foes. The base damage for your Techniques is determined by your Power. You begin play with 1 Power, unless your Species modifies it. Attack – how hard you can hit in the heat of the moment. Under most circumstances, your Attack is 0, but it can temporarily go up or down. Every one of your Strikes are modified by your Attack. Defense – whenever you're struck in combat, you reduce the damage by your Defense. You get your full Defense against all strikes made against you, even if they're made by the same attacker. For most species, your beginning Defense is 0, though this can be improved with Gear. Before we go any further, there's just a few more general rules to cover off: . | Players generally have one \"action\" per turn, representing something they want to do with the time they have. Usually this warrants a skill check (and thus, rolling dice). When there's no time pressure (such as outside of battle), these actions can be resolved in any order. | If something is measured in \"turns\", outside of battle, treat 1 turn as being about a minute. | If a number is divided in any way, unless otherwise specified, round the remainder down to the nearest whole number – to a minimum of 1. Be careful, sometimes this will go down to 0! Usually when it would give an unfair advantage for ½ of 1 to wind up the same as ½ of 2. In these cases though the minimum is specified. | . Things get a little more complicated in battle, but the following core rules are at the heart of everything in Paper Story! . ",

    "title": "Rolling and Nudging Dice",
    "content": "Paper Story uses the Nudge System, a lightweight form of conflict resolution where you roll a pool of dice, then try to nudge the results into your favour. For every Skill point and relevant Specialisation you have on any given check, you can roll an additional six-sided die (1d6). Non-player characters (NPC's) don't have Stats, Skills or Specialisations, and they don't roll at all. The spotlight is always on the players. No matter what, your success and failure hinges on your own actions. When you make a check you're using your Skill, and the Stat it falls under, to try and make something happen, which prompts a dice roll. Each time you roll your dice, you're hoping to roll 4 or more; the Target Number. When a die shows a number equal to or greater than that, it counts as a Success. And if you roll a 6, you can add another d6 to your pool and roll it, too! . Your Stats make you more consistent, allowing you to nudge the results into your favour. For every point you have in the appropriate Stat, you can modify a die result by 1. If this turns it into a 6, you can roll another d6, just the same as if you'd rolled it naturally. Example: Standard Checks . A Koopa with 3 Heart and 2 Coordination tries to hammer a Goomba, making an attack roll. He rolls two dice (2d6) for his Coordination, and rolls 4 and 1. 4 is a successful result, so this counts as 1 Success – a Nice result! He can then spend his 3 points in Heart to increase the 1 to a 4, making 2 Successes. (A Good result!) . Be warned, though – if at any point more than half of your dice are 1's, you suffer a Critical Failure! You lose all your Successes, and your action may fail spectacularly. Example: Critical Failure . A Bob-Omb with 2 Heart and 2 Guard attempts to block a spinning shell attack from an enemy Koopa. He rolls two dice (2d6) for his Guard, and rolls 4 and 1. 4 is a successful result, so this counts as 1 Success – a Nice result, able to block the damage. The Bob-Omb thinks they can do better, and nudges their 4 into a 6, giving them another d6 to roll. The new d6 comes up 1; and now more than half their dice are 1's! It's a Critical Failure. They got greedy! The Bob-Omb takes the damage full-force, and the GM decides this failure causes the Koopa to spin around them, Disorienting them for the next turn! . ",

Anything less than 1 die is rolled as 1d6, with negative numbers subtracting from the number of Successes. Example: Rolling without Dice . A Boo with 1 Courage and 0 Persuade tries to talk his way out of a dire situation. He rolls one die (1d6), with a result of 3 – he can't fix that up with his Courage, so he has no Successes! . ",

When you take an action to assist someone else's check, you take ½ the dice you would have for the action (rounded down, to a minimum of 0) and add them to the other character's dicepool. Then, they can use your Stat points as well as their own to nudge the dice in their favour. You have to have at least 1d6 yourself to assist! Otherwise your help isn't useful enough to provide any advantage. Example: Working together . A Koopa, a Bandit and a Dayzee try to lift a heavy stone statue to inspect what's underneath, using Athletics. The Koopa volunteers to lead the job; they have 3 Heart and 3 Athletics. The Bandit has 2 Heart and 2 Athletics, and the Dayzee has just 1 Heart and 1 Athletics. The Koopa can roll 3d6 from their own Athletics, and +1d6 from the Bandit – they don't get any dice from the Dayzee, because their Athletics is too low. The four dice come up 2, 2, 3 and 3. Fortunately, pooling together everyone's Heart, the group has 6 Heart to spend, enough to boost everything to 4 for a Great result! . ",

    "title": "Power-Ups",
    "content": "Power-Ups are particularly special kinds of consumable Items which provide ongoing effects for a single willing target, similar to Statuses caused by Booster Items. A character can have one Power-Up active at a time, with new Power-Ups replacing existing Power-Ups immediately. Power-Ups provide a variety of passive benefits, and can grant modifiers to Techniques or give the user access to entirely new Techniques. These Technique benefits can't be used simultaneously; you can't use a Power-Up Technique while the Power-Up enhances it, and you can't enhance your Techniques with more than one Power-Up effect. The magic of a Power-Up doesn't last long! It takes special care to preserve them for future use, requiring a Crafts, Magic or similar check to keep them safe. Typically this requires at least a Great result, though as always, you may be able to get by with less. Otherwise if they aren't used, a Power-Up will wilt or expire within a few minutes of acquiring it. Some of their magic will last, though, allowing them to be used as ordinary Items. When purchased in stores, Power-Ups come pre-preserved in special containers – accounting for their higher cost. Once a Power-Up is used, its Power-Up state lasts as long as its user is able to concentrate, typically ending on its own outside of combat or during breaks between adventure. Whenever the user takes damage from an attack or is otherwise shaken up, they have to make a Steady check to hold on; on failure, the Power-Up is lost. Each Steady check made requires a higher Grade of Success than the last check, until the Power-Up is lost. No matter what, the effects of the Power-Up don't impact this Steady check, either to make it easier or harder. Fire Flower Power-Up • 50 Coins . Bestows the power to generate fire.

For 5 FP: Rolling Rock Forms a boulder around the user, then bowls through enemies – hitting indirectly. The user can bowl over the target to strike targets behind them.

However, checks where the user's size is a hindrance, such as Guard, require a higher Grade of Success than usual. Mega Mushroom Power-Up • 200 Coins . Causes the user to grow to a tremendous size. When wilted, can be consumed for an effect similar to a Power Punch. For 5 FP: Megaton Charge The user barrels forwards with their full weight, striking all enemies in the target group.

Checks where the user's size is a hindrance, such as Coordination, require two more Grades of Success than usual; in the case of this Power-Up's Megaton Charge and Megaton Stomp, this is already factored in. Power-Ups don't need to be preserved – if you don't want to use one right away, letting it wilt so you can use it as an Item can be a solid strategy. After all, the original games didn't have any Power-Ups! . ",

For those of you new to roleplaying, TTRPG's are known as either tabletop or table-talk roleplaying games. They have common roots with their digital cousins, but are quite a bit different where it counts. Basically, one player acts as Game Master – equal parts referee and storyteller, this player controls the entire world of NPC's and oversees its rules. All the other players are responsible for their own characters and their actions. Completely responsible. The only real constraints you have are what seems reasonable to your game and the people you play with. As you might expect, these games are a lot more flexible by nature. You have the opportunity to literally play a role, and it's generally expected that you make choices that are consistent with the role of your character – even if they're not strictly speaking what a 'good' player would do. There are many more write-ups that go into deeper detail than this with respect to the big-name RPG's – Dungeons and Dragons, World of Darkness, Savage Worlds, to name a few. If that generally sounds like a lot of fun, I'd highly recommend you look into some of those games, and of course have fun with Paper Story! . ",

A character's Personal Traits are all their special qualities which are passively active, with a wide variety of effects. Generally speaking, if multiple instances of a Trait would apply – such as multiple Contact Traits – only one is active at a time. Typically this applies to the stronger Trait, or in the case of a negative Trait like Weakness, the more troublesome Weakness. This can be subjective though, and in some cases up to the character to decide, so make sure to check with your GM. ",

As an action, a character can either pick up an adjacent ally or climb aboard an adjacent ally with Carrier – similarly to Swapping, both characters can make a Coordination check to speed this up. With a Great result from both characters, this becomes a free action. During either character's turn, they can split back up as a free action, with the carried character taking up a space adjacent to the carrier. If the carrier is Dazed, Stunned or KO'd, both characters split up immediately. While a character is being carried they move with the carrier, occupy the same space in combat and take their turn after the carrier. They can't be targeted if the carrier is in the way, and likewise, the carrier can't be targeted by attacks if their passenger would block them. If an attack would affect both characters at the same time (e.g. Group, Quake), it hits them as normal. The combination of Aquatic and Carrier can be a huge help to land-bound allies.

    "title": "Clone",
    "content": "You are able to split your mind and body into two or more like-minded individuals. You retain control of all your clones. Clones can be either Copies or Illusions. Regardless of the style of cloning, the character activating a split retains all their Items, and the clone is left with none; likewise if two or more clones re-combine, the resulting character takes all of their Items. | Copies Your split characters are perfect copies of yourself, requiring you to make a Steady check as an action to split into two or for any two clones to re-combine. With a Great result this becomes a free action, but otherwise both clones lose their action for the turn. When split apart, each copy is weaker than the sum of its parts; both the original character and the clone each have their max HP, max FP, BP, Stats and Skills effectively halved. You all retain your existing HP and FP, up to the limit of your new maximums, and all clones share access to the same SP pool, as long as they're under your control. When re-combining, any HP or FP loss is carried over from the clones, and your overall abilities are recalculated as appropriate; you never risk losing stats to a rounding error. Example: Fuzzy Splits . A Fuzzy with 15 HP splits into two Fuzzies, who each have 7 HP. One of the clones then takes 1 damage, going down to 6/7 HP. When re-combining, the Fuzzy goes back to having 15 HP at maximum. Since one of the clones took 1 damage, the re-combined Fuzzy has 14/15 HP. Each clone is able to split into another pair of clones as an action, though you can only split into more clones if you have enough HP to split. As long as you retain control of the clones, they each have the combined knowledge and awareness of every other clone. It's difficult to divide your consciousness up like this; for every 10 turns that passes with your clones split apart, you must make a Steady check using your original stats and skills, requiring a Grade of Success for every 10 turns that's already passed. If you fail, you lose control of all active clones and are completely Stunned (6) for a turn. Resting can restore your lost abilities after losing control, but all your clones will remain active – and most likely, hostile. | Illusions Your split clones are illusory, requiring you to make a Magic or Trickery check as an action to conjure them. You pay 1 FP for every clone created, and can create up to 1 clone for each Grade of Success. If you attempt to create more with another action, the existing clones dissipate immediately. Each of the illusions are functionally lifeless imitations of the original, with no ability to take actions of their own. On your turn you can direct them to fly around like ghosts and act out actions, and you can perceive things as they would, but they are completely intangible and pass straight through solid matter. Despite their intangible nature, if they would be attacked or otherwise lose HP, they immediately dissipate. You can use the clones to effortlessly disguise your own actions as long as you have at least one near you. While doing so, you can Dodge as if Boosted by a Status Level equal to the number of clones near you – however when you do this, each successfully dodged attack causes one of the clones to be hit instead, destroying them. Maintaining the illusion requires constant concentration; for every turn that passes with your illusory clones active you must choose and attempt one of the following: . | Pay 1 FP for every clone still active, and 1 FP for every turn that's already passed. | Make a Steady check with a Grade of Success for every turn that's already passed. | . If you fail to do either of the above your illusory clones disappear, though you suffer no other consequences. | . In the thick of battle, it doesn't matter if your illusions are unconvincing – they just need to distract the enemy for a split second . ",

If you reduce an attack's damage to 0 by blocking, and no Weaknesses apply, you can't suffer any Status effects from it, which might otherwise apply if you're simply tanking it with Defense.

A Bob-Omb is attacked by a Fire Bro's fireball, dealing 2 damage, and a Paragoomba's dive, dealing 1 damage. The Bob-Omb reacts by blocking, and gets a Good result, allowing them to block 2 points of damage.

Superguards are more potent blocks, allowing you to completely ignore all damage and Statuses from the attack and even ignore your own Weakness! Better still, you can interrupt your attacker by dealing damage, stopping them from making more attacks.

However, First Aid is only really useful as an initial response – each time you perform First Aid on a target, the required Grades of Success increase by 1 until they get some rest. If you fail a Heal check like this, you instead cause them to lose HP equal to ½ your Power. Or worse, if you fail spectacularly. | . Example: Recovery . After a tough fight, a Dayzee's ally is injured and still suffering from a poison for 4 more turns. The Dayzee makes a Heal check to administer First Aid, with a Good result. They're able to restore 4 HP and reduce the poison to 2 turns. In the time it takes to perform First Aid, their ally suffers from another turn of poison (reducing the duration to 1 turn) – the Dayzee makes another Heal check, but only gets a Nice result. Because they've already administered First Aid once, this isn't enough, and they end up hurting their ally instead. | Administering Medicine When using an Item to restore a target's HP or FP, you can make a Heal check alongside your Item action; each Grade of Success adds a quarter of the HP/FP restoring properties of the Item to the target. This includes all healing applications, including healing over time like Slow Shrooms or Gradual Syrups, but the Item has to already restore HP or FP respectively. If you fail a Heal check like this, you just waste the Item; if you fail spectacularly there might be worse consequences, too. | . Example: Medicinal Aid . In the middle of a tough battle, a Boo wizard is seriously injured and low on energy. Their Squeek ally pulls out a Honey Mushroom for them, which would heal 5 HP and 5 FP. They use the Honey Mushroom on their Boo ally, and try to boost it with a Heal check, earning a Good result. For each Grade of Success, they add ¼ of 5 to HP and FP, which rounded down would be 1. So for 3 Grades of Success, they add +3 HP and +3 FP, for a total of 8 HP and 8 FP. It's difficult to find the time in battle to heal. Usually it's better to prevent damage by focusing on your attacks, and to worry about healing afterwards; but if you neglect your health, you'll be sure to regret it further down the line . ",

    "content": "Crafts (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to develop useable products from raw materials, which may otherwise be useless. First, choose an Item, Power-Up, Badge or Gear you want to make and have the materials for. A Nice result is enough to make something with an equivalent value of 5 Coins; for each Grade of Success earned, you can double the value range of the Items you can make, as follows: . | Nice!: 5 Coins | Good!: 10 Coins | Great!: 20 Coins | Wonderful!: 40 Coins | Excellent!: 80 Coins | Unbelievable!: 160 Coins | . Failure consumes all materials involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes. Example: Crafting Gear . A Koopa smithy wants to smith a Super Hammer. Super Gear costs a whopping 400 Coins, so this is a tall order, but it's well worth the effort. They earn a Wonderful result, for an equivalent of 40 Coins; an impressive outcome but only a fifth of the way there. They try to push themselves to keep working, and earn a Great result on the second check; this only adds on 10 Coins, for a total of 50. They decide to set the project aside before they make a Mistake, but take pride that their new Gear is 1/8 complete. Once you've created something or otherwise know how it's made, it becomes easier to craft, with value starting from 10 Coins on a Nice result. In any case, one attempt to Craft can only produce one Item, Gear or Power-Up at a time, and can't produce enhanced or mixed Items. Depending on the quality of the materials you use, you may be able to craft Items with less Grades of Success than normal; however, appropriate materials must always be sourced and used up. As a general rule, when it comes to materials: . | Items can be made with common materials which can be sourced on the cheap in most settlements, costing no more than half the Item's value. | Badges and Gear require more valuable and rarer materials, which may take more work to find on the market, or require the crafter to seek them out in the field. | Power-Ups require some form of magical charge, either taken from rare materials, or crafted with Magic assistance (as a Skill Substitution or Skill Enhancement; if you have an ally assisting, you don't necessarily have to do the magic yourself). | . If you don't achieve a high enough result, you can either settle for a similar product you could have made with the materials you used instead (such as settling for a Mushroom over a Super Mushroom), accept failure and make a Mistake, or take the time to make another check; each additional check made in this way takes more time, and successive checks without rest require a higher Grade of Success. Tracking down the materials for crafting can be an adventure in and of itself, taking you to far away places with all sorts of exotic goods. ",

    "title": "Crafts - Enhancing and Mixing",
    "content": "In addition to creating things from scratch, Crafts (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to enhance or combine consumable Items. For each Grade of Success, you can choose one of the following effects to apply to the new Item: . | Consume another Item, adding all of its effects (HP, FP, gradual recovery, damage, Status, etc.) to the new Item, using the first Item's targets. No matter what, you can't combine more than two Items at once. | Increase an existing HP and/or FP recovery effect by 2. | Increase the Item's damage by 1 (if it would deal damage). | Add an Element or replace an existing Element, changing the type of damage dealt. | Add a Status, or increase an existing Status Level by 1. New Statuses have the same duration as the original Item's Statuses (if applicable), lasting up to a minimum of 1 turn. | Increase the duration of all the Item's Statuses and other effects by 1 turn. | . Failure instead consumes all Items involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes. Cooking can be a costly exercise, but well worth it! Stronger attacks, better healing, and simply condensing multiple Items into one Inventory slot are all good reasons to top up when you're in town. Once you've created an Item or otherwise know its recipe, it becomes easier to make it again, requiring half as many Grades of Success (to a minimum of Nice). However, you have to use the same method when following a recipe – a chef sweetening an Ice Storm to make an Icicle Pop is very different to an alchemist strengthening it to make a Blizzard Storm, for instance. Treat the new Item's Coin value as equivalent to ½ of its component Items' values, +5 more Coins for each Grade of Success required to make it (not accounting for the halved Grades of a known recipe). Including a previously enhanced or mixed Item in your crafting adds one more Grade of Success to the recipe's difficulty for each time an ingredient was previously enhanced or mixed, as it becomes a more volatile ingredient. Example: Mixing Items . A Dayzee wants to combine some delicious Honey Syrup with their own special recipe, a Fried Sparkshroom (combining a Super Shroom and a Volt Shroom). They make a Crafts roll, and earn a Good result. Since the Fried Sparkshroom was previously mixed together, they need one more Grade of Success to go ahead with this recipe. They have just enough Grades to finish off the recipe, slathering the mushroom to make a Glazed Sparkshroom, which restores 10 HP, 5 FP and bestows the same Contact Trait as a Volt Shroom. If they wanted to sell this invention, it would have an equivalent value of 27 Coins (15 from the Fried Sparkshroom, 2 from the Honey Syrup and 10 from their Good result). Just be careful you don't take things too far. You wouldn't want that powerful Superbombomb you've been working on to backfire once you take it into the field, would you? . ",

    "title": "Magic - Spontaneous Spells",
    "content": "Magic's most powerful quality is its versatility – the ability to do anything! These rules apply whenever you would cast a spell that's not already a key part of your repertoire, like a Technique, representing the challenging art of spontaneous casting. Whatever kind of spell you cast, you choose beforehand how much of your Magic dicepool to use; this includes dice you receive from your Skill, your relevant Specialisations and Boosts to your Magic skill. It doesn't include situational bonuses, though, like the extra dice you'd get for someone's assistance. For each die included in your pool, you pay 3 FP. If you have a relevant Specialisation, you pay 2 FP per die instead, and if you have a relevant Efficient trait, you only pay 1 FP per die. No matter the circumstances, you always pay at least as much FP as one die would cost. Regardless, the final roll is modified by your Spirit as normal for a Magic check. Keep in mind though that no matter what, Magic spells can't be used to gain or bestow FP or SP (Exceptional Results aside). | Skill Substitution Magic can be used to emulate other skills, such as Athletics, Notice or Bully, by making a Magic check instead – completely replacing the check you'd make with your Magic pool. | Skill Enhancement As long as you would normally have dice for the check, you can enhance it with Magic; this works as if you made the check, and were also assisted by yourself using your Magic. You pay FP to access your Magic dicepool as normal, then add ½ of that dicepool (to a minimum of 0) and your Spirit onto the main Skill check. Even if the main check used Spirit, you can still add your Spirit again! . | . Example: Enhanced Skills . A Koopa sorcerer comes under attack! While they have 2 Heart and 1 Guard, they're much better at spellcasting, with 3 Spirit and 2 Magic. They can pay 6 FP to use their two Magic dice; as they're assisting themselves, they add half of that onto their main Guard dicepool, for +1d6 and a total of 2d6. The dice come up 1 and 2; since they can use both their Heart and their Spirit, this is enough to boost both dice to 4's for a Good result. | Enchantments Magic can be used to temporarily enchant targets with Personal Traits, such as Fly, Invisibility or Mimicry. Make a Magic check and choose a Personal Trait; if you succeed, the target receives the chosen Trait, lasting for 1 turn for each Magic die you used. Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher. For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | The Enchantment lasts for one more turn. | The Enchantment includes another Trait. | A numerical value of one of the Traits increases by +1. | One of the Traits includes one more element (if applicable). | The Enchantment affects one more valid target. | . If the target already has a Trait they would receive from this enchantment, the enchantment temporarily overrides their Trait; this can be used to substitute existing Immunities and Resistances. | . You have to specify any particulars of the Trait, such as the elements affected or the exact Contact effect, when you cast the enchantment; these effects should be based on existing Personal Traits, with the GM having final say on what's possible. Any FP costs associated with the Trait cost double FP; however, you can substitute that with whatever FP you spent casting the enchantment, for as long as the enchantment lasts. As an added bonus, any action taken or checks made to initiate the Trait (such as starting to fly or transforming with Mimicry) use the action and Magic check of the enchantment instead. Trying to take these actions after being enchanted requires the target roll as normal, though. Example: Enchanting Traits . A Goomba enchanter is sneaking along behind their Boo ally; their friend is able to fly and turn invisible, and not wanting to get left behind, the Goomba decides they should too. They decide to be conservative and pay 6 FP for two of their Magic dice. They get a Good result, and choose to give themselves the Invisibility Trait; they also add in the Fly Trait, and make it last an extra turn, for a total of 3 turns. They immediately turn invisible and start flying. Ordinarily it would cost 2 FP to turn invisible for a turn, and 2 FP for each turn after that; but because they've already spent 6 FP, they're already covered for as long as the enchantment lasts! . | Curses Similarly, Magic can be used to temporarily neutralise the target's qualities and other Personal Traits. Make a Magic check and choose a quality the target has (e.g. a Personal Trait, a Status delivered by their attack, or an elemental affinity of their attack); if you succeed, the target suffers a Curse as if it was a Status, temporarily neutralising their ability to use that quality in some fashion. They can recover as normal, such as with Items or Steady, and players can make a Steady check to resist as a reaction, just like any other Status. The Curse lasts for 1 turn for each Magic die you used. For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | The Curse lasts for one more turn. | The Curse includes another quality. | The Curse affects one more valid target. | . | . Example: A Curse on Ye . A Squeek wizard is beset on all sides by a storm of 4 Paratroopas – and their allies are firmly set on the ground. They attempt to bring the enemy down to earth, spending 8 FP to use their full 4 dice from 3 Magic and a Specialisation in Curses, earning a Great result. They choose to remove the Paratroopas' ability to fly, equivalent to the Fly Trait. With their Grades of Success, they're able to ground each of their enemies for 4 turns. Curses come in many forms, but usually, they're a horrible time. There's not much you can do besides tough it out. | Technique Spells Magic can even be used to improvise Techniques on the fly! Instead of making any Technique checks, you make one Magic check to conjure up an effect; as long as you succeed, this Technique begins with 1 Grade of Success in any of its Primary or Secondary checks, and an effective FP cost of 0. For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | Add 3 FP to the final Technique's effective cost. | Add a Grade of Success to the outcome of the Technique's Primary and/or Secondary Checks. | . You can select up to your dicepool in positive Traits, and up to your dicepool in negative Traits, as long as the FP cost for the combined Traits doesn't exceed the effective cost. Finally, you can add Indirect, Ranged and/or Harmless as bonus Traits for no additional cost; this is simply the nature of Magic. You don't pay the effective cost, or make any further checks – the Technique simply resolves with whatever Traits and Grades of Success you chose to give it based on your Magic check. Since it doesn't make its own check, you can't benefit from its results on top of your own check (such as for Exceptional Results). | . Example: Improvised Spells . A Dayzee witch wants to cast a hex on their enemies, but doesn't have the right Techniques for the job. Instead, they improvise. They spend 8 FP to use their full 4 dice from 3 Magic with a Specialisation in Hexes, and earn a Great result. They can add up to 4 positive Traits, and up to 4 negative Traits. They want the hex to stop all their enemies in their tracks, so they add Group, Lengthen and Daze x3, giving the hex an effective cost of 8 FP. They don't need it to deal any damage though, and they're sure it will work without a hitch; so they give it the negative traits Harmless and Commitment, reducing the effective cost to just 3 FP. Finally, they take their 3 Grades of Success; 1 is spent increasing the FP pool for the Technique to 3, which is enough to pay the effective cost. The last 2 are spent to give the Technique a Great Grade of Success. The end result is a Technique that Dazes (3) their enemies for 4 turns, giving them plenty of time to act. ",

    "content": "By spending SP as an action, you can improvise a Technique on the fly! Spend 5 SP or more and specify the Technique you want to use. It can include: . | 1 of your Tech Default sets; as per usual, this doesn't affect the effective FP cost. | Any applicable Optional and Required Tech Defaults you have; Required Tech Defaults must be included, as per usual, and neither affect the effective FP cost. | Up to one unique positive and up to one unique negative Technique Trait for every 5 SP you spent. You can add on Traits already included as a Tech Default, but otherwise can't repeat Traits. If the Trait can be taken multiple times and was added here, you can include up to one copy for every 5 SP spent. | . The final effective FP cost can't be worth more than ½ the SP spent, so you may have to take on some negative Traits too! Keep in mind when using Technique Traits that include other Traits in their cost (such as Coin Toss), all the included Traits must be accounted for through SP. Finally, you use and resolve the Technique! You don't spend any FP or even roll for it. The improvised Technique's effectiveness depends entirely on how much SP you spend, with its Primary and Secondary Checks automatically earning a Grade of Success each for every 5 SP you spent. Finally, no matter what, your improvised Technique can't restore HP, FP or SP. Whatever you improvise, it has to make sense and be something your character could reasonably accomplish; but other than that, the sky's the limit! . Example: A Dash of Inspiration . A Pianta is confronted by a gang of flying Lakitus! With their Goomba ally KO'd, and no Aerial or Ranged Techniques, he has no choice but to run – or so it would seem. By spending 10 SP, the Pianta can improvise a truly impressive Technique! They include Strong as a Tech Default, then add two additional Traits from their SP – Ranged, and Strike-Through. The end result is a Technique with Strong, Ranged and Strike-Through x2 (which is added twice, because of the SP spent). This would normally have an effective FP cost of 4 FP, barely less than the 5 FP limit they had to work with! With a mighty shotput hurl, they launch the Goomba through as many Lakitus as possible! .

A number of different Statuses can be dealt out to characters over the course of a battle or adventure, both positive and negative. A Status' duration is measured in turns; for each full turn that passes for the character with that Status (not including Surprise Rounds), its duration is reduced by 1, until it ends at 0. No matter where a character receives their Status, the same Statuses never stack – you can't be poisoned twice, and you can't Boost Attack twice in a row, so only the highest level of that Status is treated as active. In the thick of combat statuses are more volatile and tend to be measured in turns, but outside of battle, you can generally treat each minute of game time as a turn. The severity of each Status is based on its Status Level, which can be shortened to a number in brackets next to it, like (1). If an effect would require you to roll under the Status Level, but success isn't possible (i.e. the Status Level is 6 or more), you don't have to roll.

Techniques are the myriad ways a character acts in combat, most often by attacking. By default, all Techniques start from the same template: . Basic Attack (0 FP) Coordination: Auto: [Power] DMG Nice!: [2 x Power] DMG (No Traits) . Techniques require the user to pass a Primary Check in order to deal damage, which defaults to their Coordination. The results vary depending on their overall success. As in the above example, Techniques can still function with no Grades of Success, but improve with better results – though this threshold for success can be increased, making it harder to hit the minimum and maximum results.

While Single-Strike attacks can be made to hit additional targets with Traits like Burst or Strike-Through, this gives up some of the raw power. Multi-Strike . Multi-Strike attacks split some of the force up between their hits, dealing a portion of the attack's damage potential with each hit; as a general rule, each strike should deal no more than [Power] in damage. They strike once if successful, then can make one more strike for each additional Grade of Success earned, but the total base damage of the split strikes can't be more than [2 x Power]. Taking damage at any point during an attack (such as from a Contact Trait) interrupts and cancels the Technique, but doesn't prevent the strike's damage. Multi-Strike attacks take a bit more work than Single-Strike attacks, but the more strikes you make, the more damage you can get from Attack boosts! . ",

    "content": "When defining your Techniques you have a wide variety of Traits to modify them with, which either increase or decrease the Technique's final FP cost. If this reduces your FP cost to 0 or less, the Technique doesn't cost any FP. Your Species' Tech Defaults are especially useful here – you can add on one of your Tech Default sets without modifying the FP cost at all! Any Optional Tech Defaults which would apply can be added on as well without FP. Required Tech Defaults must be added where they would apply, and don't modify FP. Generally you can only take a Trait once, with different forms of the Trait (e.g. different elements) counting as separate distinct Traits. While you can stack as many Traits on a Technique as you please, there are limits to how much FP you can save with negative Traits. You can only save FP from a number of Traits equal to your level. Any other negative Traits you add contribute to the overall Technique's effect, but don't modify FP at all. Example: Negative Traits . A level 1 Buzzy Beetle wants to begin play with a powerful 0 FP attack. They could add Strong for 2 FP, and offset it with Unwieldy, for a powerful – but inaccurate – melee attack. They could add more negative Traits, but since they can only save FP from one Trait at a time, they decide to leave it there to start with. While you can describe a Technique in shorthand by referring to its Traits, in practice it's better to write out the full effect for your own reference – you may not always remember that a Piercing attack ignores Defense, or you may need to record how your Boost Technique works at different Grades of Success. While the mechanics of building a Technique can be complicated, it's best to work within this system until you have a good idea of how Techniques work and what effects should cost. If you find that you just can't make the Technique of your dreams, or your Technique isn't as effective as it should be, try discussing alternatives with your GM. You should consider this system to be a starting point for your own exciting ideas! . ",

    "content": "Some Traits have similar functions which are referred to in shorthand, explained here. [X] . This Trait can be chosen multiple times to strengthen its effects; additional instances are treated as the same singular Trait, but with effects varying based on how many times the Trait has been taken, [X]. If there's a limit on how many times it can be taken, this is referred to as the Cap. Note that multiple instances of these values are added together, not multiplied. If [X] is 3, then [XX] would be 6 (3 + 3), and [XXXX] would be 12 (3 + 3 + 3 + 3). [Secondary] . After the Primary Check is resolved, as long as it didn't fail and there's still a valid target, some Techniques have follow-up effects which require a Secondary Check. The Skill required for this is defined by the Trait it's acquired from – if the Trait lists multiple Skills, choose one of them when you first define the Technique, and if the Technique has multiple [Secondary] Traits, choose one skill to represent all Secondary effects. In any case, you only roll one Secondary Check for all relevant effects. If multiple targets would be affected, they all suffer the consequences of the same Secondary Check. [Approach] . This Trait modifies the way the user approaches their target(s). Generally, multiple [Approach] Traits can't be taken at once. [Target] . This Trait modifies the available targets for this Technique in some way. Generally, multiple [Target] Traits can't be taken at once. [Strikes] . This Trait modifies the way Strikes and damage are allocated in some way, making it fundamentally different from a Single-Strike or Multi-Strike Technique. Generally, multiple Strikes Traits can't be taken at once. [Random] . This Trait features a random element. Multiple [Random] Traits can't be taken at once, unless otherwise specified. ",

    "content": "Aerial (+2 FP) [Approach] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. The user flies through the air to deliver this attack, striking from above. This allows them to hit targets from anywhere in the fight, though they may struggle to hit targets who are blocked in some way (e.g. under a low ceiling). If the user is flying when they make an Aerial attack, they can Plummet as they make this attack. Plummeting attacks are made at +1 Power, but require one more Grade of Success on their Primary Check. Regardless of the outcome, the user becomes grounded after a Plummeting attack. All (+3 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all available targets, be they friend or foe, besides the user. At the user's option this can also include the Indirect Trait for no additional cost. Allies (+2 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all of the user's allies, but not themselves. At the user's option this can also include the Indirect Trait for no additional cost. Alternative (+2 FP) . Choose HP, SP or Coins: . | HP: This Technique spends HP instead of FP. It can't recover HP, and can't be combined with Blowback or varieties of Self that deal damage to the user. | SP: This Technique spends SP instead of FP. It can't recover SP, even through Exceptional Results (though Exceptional Techniques are still possible). | Coins: This Technique spends 5 Coins for every 1 FP it would cost. It can't steal Coins through Snatch, and can't cover an equivalent cost of more than 10 FP (for 50 Coins). | . The effective FP cost can't be reduced lower than 1 FP by negative Traits while using Alternative. Boost (+2 FP) [Secondary - Cheer/Magic] [X] . The target's abilities are Boosted for [X] turns – the exact abilities affected by the Boost are decided when this Trait is bought. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. This Technique can also use the following skills for Secondary Checks, depending on the ability being Boosted: . | Attack: Athletics or Coordination | Defense: Guard | Dodge: Trickery | Skill (e.g. Steady): The same Skill being Boosted | . If this Boost Technique has an element, it also has the following effects depending on the ability Boosted: . | Attack: The target's attacks have the same element for the duration. | Defense: The target's Resist for that element is Boosted, too. | . Burst (+2 FP) [Strikes] [Target] [X] . This Technique acts as a Single-Strike Technique on the initial target, then repeats on up to [X] valid targets in front of them, and up to [X] valid targets behind them, ignoring elevation. Each subsequent attack deals -1 damage (to a minimum of 1), calculated for each direction separately. Charm (+2 FP) [Secondary - Magic/Persuade/Trickery] [X] . The target is Charmed, causing them to be easily persuaded, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. An enemy Charmed is an enemy you don't have to deal with, and an asset to fight your enemies! Even outside of combat, Charm can be incredibly useful. Coin Toss (+? FP) [Random] . This Technique has 2 different Coin Slots made up of Technique Traits, each assigned either Heads or Tails. When you use this Technique, flip a coin. Only the Slot whose side comes up is active for this use of the Technique, and the other Slot's Traits are ignored. Each Coin Slot can include any number of Technique Traits, with their FP cost calculated separately from your own Technique, including all of their negative Traits. The two Coin Slots must be different from one another in some way. The overall FP cost Coin Toss adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | ½ of the highest positive FP cost in both Coin Slots. | +1 FP for each Trait included in the Coin Slot with the most Traits. | -1 FP if one of the Coin Slots is empty. | If either Coin Slot has a negative FP cost, include ½ of it in Coin Toss' FP cost. | . If after this Coin Toss would have a negative FP cost, you can treat it as a negative Trait instead. Example: Heads or Tails . A gambling Shy Guy spins into a wild, uncontrolled kick! Essentially, they flip a coin; if it comes up Heads, they can add Strong to their kick! If it comes up Tails, though, they Exhaust themselves instead. On the Heads side, Strong would normally cost 2 FP, so they add ½ that for +1 FP to the cost. Looking at Tails though, Exhausting would save -4 FP; so they take ½ that away, for -2 FP. Both sides have the same number of Traits, so they add +1 FP for 1 Trait. The gambler's kick is so risky, it would actually work out to 0 FP overall! . Counter (+3 FP) . This Technique's Primary Check defaults to either Athletics or Steady. Instead of the usual effect of this Technique, the target gains the qualities of this Technique (excluding Counter, [Approach] and [Target] traits) as a Contact Trait, either through some direct hazard or a counter-attack from the original user. This Contact Trait lasts for 1 turn for each Grade of Success. When the Contact Trait is triggered, it automatically succeeds and targets the attacker (ignoring their own Contact traits) with the same number of Grades of Success as the original user's Primary Check. Secondary Checks are made as required when their Contact trait is triggered; depending on the nature of the trait, either the target or the original user make the check. Confuse (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Confused, causing them to behave unpredictably, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Daze (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Dazed for [X] turns, preventing them from fighting back. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Disarm (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Disarmed for [X] turns, preventing them from using the targeted attack or Trait – the exact Traits (e.g. Tool) or manner of attack (e.g. jump attacks) affected by this status are decided when this Trait is chosen. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Dismiss (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Heal/Magic/Trickery] . For each Grade of Success, the user can choose one of the target's Statuses, their current Power-Up or a temporary Terrain affecting them. | Statuses or Terrain: Reduce duration by -1 for each Grade of Success this Technique earned overall. | Power-Up: The target must try to hold onto their Power-Up, as if they took damage; their check requires an additional Grade of Success for each Grade of Success this Secondary Check earned overall. | . Disorient (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Disoriented for [X] turns, reducing the effectiveness of all actions requiring their senses. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Divider (+3 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is cut off from their allies, separating into another distinct group for at least [X] turns – or until they can reasonably reconnect with the original group. If there are multiple targets, they can be divided into separate groups, creating up to 1 other group for each additional Grade of Success and a maximum of [X] new groups. If multiple targets are divided into the same group, they maintain their relative position and turn order in the new group. Drain (+1 FP) [X] . This attack heals the user an amount equal to the total damage dealt, up to a maximum of [XX] HP. Element (+1 FP) [X] . This attack carries up to [X] different elemental qualities, such as Fire, Ice or Shock. If it has multiple elements, they all apply at the same time. Elements don't do anything on their own, but they can be useful in different situations. Note that Immunities apply before Weaknesses, and Immunities and Weaknesses each overrule Resistances. So if one element would trigger an enemy's Immunity, the whole Technique does. Empower (+2 FP) [X] . As long as this Technique's Secondary Check succeeds, it functions as if it had [X] additional Grades of Success. Fear (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Trickery] [X] . The target either flees the fight or becomes Stunned (their choice) for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Flowery (+2 FP) [Secondary - Cheer/Magic] [X] . This Technique restores +1 FP to the target for every Grade of Success, to a maximum of [X] FP. Group (+4 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all targets in the chosen group. If targeting their own group, the user can choose whether or not it affects them too. At the user's option this can include the Indirect Trait. Hearty (+1 FP) [Secondary - Heal/Magic] [X] . This Technique heals the target 1 HP for every Grade of Success, to a maximum of [XX] HP. Homing (+1 FP) . This Technique can't be Dodged and ignores the Secure Status. It can still be Blocked. If a target has any clones in battle (illusory or otherwise), this Technique can ignore them to strike the target instead. Hustle (+6 FP) [X - Cap 5] . The target begins to Hustle, giving them additional actions, for the next [X] turns. If you target yourself with this Technique, you don't receive the benefit until after this turn. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Indirect (+2 FP) . This attack doesn't strike the target directly. The user is generally shielded from the consequences of the target's Contact Traits, though depending on the attack and the Contact trait there are exceptions. Launch (+2 FP) [Secondary - Athletics/Bully] [X] . The target is launched across the battlefield after being attacked, flying through one valid target in the same group behind them (at the same elevation) for each Grade of Success. If they collide with a target with a relevant Contact trait, they stop flying and suffer the consequences of that Contact. Each additional target hit during this launch is struck with base damage equal to this Technique's Power, unmodified by the user's Attack; if the launched target has a relevant Contact trait, each new target suffers the consequences of that Contact. A maximum of [X] targets can be launched by this Technique at once, with all launches being resolved simultaneously. Afterwards, all targets return to their original position, if able – although in precarious fights, a solid enough launcher could shift the battlefield completely, or bring the fight to an early close. Lengthen (+1 FP) [X] . The effects of this Technique which have a duration last [X] more turns. Lingering (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic] [X] . The target suffers a Lingering burn, poison or other degenerative effect, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Lucky Hit (+? FP) [Random] . This Technique has a rare special effect! It contains a Lucky Slot made up of Technique Traits. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6; the Lucky Slot's Traits are only active if you roll a 6. The Lucky Slot can contain any number of Technique Traits, with their FP cost calculated separately from your own Technique, including all of their negative Traits; the Lucky Slot's overall FP cost must be positive. The overall FP cost Lucky Hit adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | 1/3 of the overall FP cost. | +1 FP for each pair of Traits included, including copies of the same Trait. | . Example: Lucky Critical . A roguish Swooper strikes from the shadows! Their attack has a 1 in 6 chance to land a devastating Lucky Hit! The Lucky Slot contains 4 instances of Strong, which would normally cost 8 FP. This cost is divided by 3 and rounded down, for 2 FP. Since it contains 4 Traits (two pairs), another +2 FP is added. Overall, this Lucky Hit costs 4 FP – half the usual cost! . You can combine Lucky Hit with Fumble. If the Technique has both traits, roll the same die once for both effects. Minion (+3 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Cheer/Magic/Persuade] [Target] [X] . This Technique generates one or more minions in any location in your group, and then targets them with any other effects of this Technique, including damage. These minions are all functionally identical to one another, though they might look superficially different, and the number of minions summoned and their qualities are defined separately for each possible result when you buy this Trait. These minions don't act during the round they're summoned, and persist for up to [X] rounds after that round. If they would have the Elevation or Fly traits, they can enter the battle with these active with no further action required. Minions follow your orders, acting in turn order as usual. They have one Technique, and can reliably use their Personal Traits, but besides that they can't take on complicated tasks which would normally require a skill check (e.g. Crafts, Guard, Notice). For those actions they can carry out, minions automatically score Grades of Success on their Primary and Secondary checks equal to this Technique's Grades of Success (to a maximum of [X] Grades), with -1 for each minion summoned besides themselves. For each Grade of Success, you can assign up to 5 points to their qualities in the following combinations, to a maximum of [XXXXX] points split across up to [X] minions: . | HP, receiving 2x the points assigned to this quality in HP. Just like regular characters, minions can't restore HP beyond their maximum. They begin with just 1 HP. | Power or Defense, receiving 1 point in either for every 2 points assigned to this quality. Minions begin with 0 Power and 0 Defense. | Up to [X] positive Traits and up to [X] negative Traits for their Technique. The Technique's final FP cost must be 0 for the minion to use it; you can reduce it by a further 1 FP for every 1 point assigned to this quality. | Up to [X] positive Personal Traits (e.g. Fly) and up to [X] negative Personal Traits (e.g. Weakness), at a cost of 2 points for every positive Trait added, and earning a free positive Trait (ignoring the maximum Trait count) for every negative Trait added. Distinct copies of the same Trait (e.g. Weakness (Blast) and Weakness (Fire)) must be added separately. Distinct effects of Immunities and Weaknesses (such as recovering HP or causing Daze) can be tailored to suit the minion, though they should be in line with existing Traits. | . Overrun (+2 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all targets in the target group at the same elevation, as long as the user can reach that height. Piercing (+3 FP) . This attack ignores Defense, Resistances and Immunities. It can still be Blocked. Provoke (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery/Persuade] [X] . The target becomes Provoked, causing them to focus their attention on a particular valid target (specified by you), for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [XX]. Quake (+3 FP) [Approach] [Target] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. This attack affects all targets in the chosen group, besides the user, in contact with the ground, wall or ceiling. As a result, it also functions as the Indirect Trait and, if it has no other element, has Element (Earth, Quake). Ranged (+2 FP) [Approach] . This Technique's Primary Check defaults to Aim. This Technique can affect its targets in battle without making contact, regardless of their relative position or other targets in the way. Reach (+1 FP) [Approach] . This Technique can target flying and grounded enemies that aren't blocked by another target, as if the user was at their elevation. It still makes contact unless paired with Indirect. Repeat (+3 FP) [Strikes] . The user repeatedly attacks with single strikes, hitting once for each Grade of Success; each strike deals damage equal to this Technique's Power, -1 for each successive attack made (to a minimum of 1 damage). There's no limit to how many strikes can be made. Revive (+10 FP) [Secondary - Heal/Magic] . The target is revived from their KO with 1 HP (in addition to any HP they would gain from this Technique), and are able to act in the same round; if their turn would have already passed for the round, they're able to act immediately after this turn. If for whatever reason this Technique would deal damage, it's dealt after they're revived and healed, and the target can resist as normal. Roulette (+? FP) [Random] . This Technique has 6 different Roulette Slots of Technique Traits, each with a different number between 1 and 6 assigned to them. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6. Only the Slot whose number is rolled is active for this use of the Technique, and all other Roulette Slot Traits are ignored. Each Roulette Slot can include any number of Technique Traits, with their FP cost calculated separately from your own Technique, including all of their negative Traits. Each Roulette Slot must be different from the others in some way. The overall FP cost Roulette adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | The highest FP cost in all your Roulette Slots (to a minimum of 0 FP); you don't pay the FP cost for any other Slots. | +1 FP for each Trait included in the Roulette Slot with the most Traits. | -2 FP for each Roulette Slot with a negative cost. | . If after this Roulette would have a negative FP cost, you can treat it as a negative Trait instead. Otherwise, if Roulette would cost 0 FP, increase the cost to 1 FP. Example: Elemental Roulette . A Magikoopa conjures a blast of prismatic energy, shifting between 6 different elements at random. Each Roulette Slot has a different Element Trait, but no other Traits. The magician only has to pay for one of those Roulette Slots (costing 1 FP), then +1 FP for the one Trait used. Thus, Roulette would add +2 FP, instead of the +6 FP normally paid for each Element added together. Safe (+2 FP) . This Trait can only be applied to multi-target attacks. This Technique doesn't affect the user or their allies. Scaling (+3 FP) [X] . This Technique acts as if the user had +1 Power for each additional Grade of Success achieved on the Primary Check beyond its maximum, up to a maximum of +[XX] Power. Secure (+4 FP) [Secondary - Guard/Magic/Trickery] . The target becomes Secure, rendering them completely immune to most Techniques targeting them for 1 turn; if this Technique would deal damage to or inflict status on the target, those effects take priority first. Selective (+1 FP) [Target] . This Technique can target any one foe at the same elevation as the user, regardless of blocking or their relative position. Sequential (+2 FP) [Strikes] [Target] . The user attacks their target, then for each additional Grade of Success earned beyond the maximum result, moves to and attacks the next available target. Each target is struck one after another, and must be a valid target – though the additional targets can be attacked in melee even if they would normally be blocked by their allies. Each strike acts as a Single-Strike, dealing twice the user's Power in raw damage. Shared (+1 FP) . The user can share in all the effects of this Technique's Secondary Check, as if they were targeted. If the Technique would have targeted them anyway, they don't receive any additional benefit; they're only added as a target. Simple (+2 FP) [X] . This Technique is easier to use, acting as if it scored [X] additional Grades of Success on the Primary Check; if the maximum effectiveness can be reached with only those Grades, then the user can choose to forego their roll for the Primary Check. Snatch (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Trickery] . This check can be opposed by Athletics, Coordination or Steady. Based on the number of Grades of Success, you can choose to take one of the following from the target (if they have something to take): . | Nice!: 1d6 Coins for each Grade of Success. | Good!: A small Item | Great!: A large Item | Wonderful!: An equipped Item, such as a Tool or a Badge | . If multiple targets would be affected by this Technique, you can attempt to steal from each of them by dividing the total Grades of Success between all applicable targets. Example: Multi-Snatch . An Overrun Snatch that affected three targets with a Wonderful result could assign two Grades of Success to one target (stealing a small Item), and split up the remaining two Grades of Success to steal from the other targets (stealing 1d6 Coins from each). Spillover (+1 FP) [Target] . This Technique targets a single valid target. However, if it deals enough damage to KO its initial target, you can target another valid target and attack them with the excess raw damage, continuing on until all the raw damage has been allocated. Note that since each new target is attacked separately, Attack and other modifiers to damage are calculated separately for each target. Split (+1 FP) . The user can divide this Technique's effects between any valid targets, including themselves, such as to heal themselves with Hearty instead of the target, or to use different Element traits against different enemies. It can't be used to redirect damage, and the new targets must have been valid choices at the time the Technique was used . Strike-Through (+1 FP) [Strikes] [Target] [X] . This Technique acts as a Single-Strike Technique on the initial target, then repeats on up to [X] valid targets behind them (at the same elevation). Each subsequent attack deals -1 damage (to a minimum of 1). Strong (+2 FP) [X] . This Technique has +[X] Power. Stun (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Stunned for [X] turns, stopped dead in their tracks. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [XX]. Swap (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Coordination/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target swaps position with another target in the same group, maintaining their current elevation where possible. The second target can't be further away in group order than 1 space for each Grade of Success, to a maximum of [X] spaces away. If this Technique affects multiple targets, each target can only be swapped once. Terrain (+3 FP) [Secondary - Crafts/Magic] [X] . The environment around the target shifts for [X] turns, causing a Terrain to form around them. The exact Terrain this Technique causes is chosen when this Trait is bought. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Terrain Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. If the target is already in a similar Terrain (e.g. both Terrains are Weathers), the new Terrain overrides the old one. If the target is able to change position (e.g. by Swapping), the Terrain stays in the same place, and may affect different targets. Throw (+2 FP) [Target] [Strikes] [X - Cap 2] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. The target is bodily hurled into the next available target. Both targets are struck as a single Strike, and trigger any Contact Traits the other target has, though only the original target suffers any secondary effects of the attack. If [X] is 2, you can aim the target as if with the Ranged Trait, and can use Aim as the Primary Check. Tool (+1 FP) . This Technique relies on a hand-held tool, such as a hammer or staff, and can't be used if the appropriate equipment isn't available. As a result it also has Indirect or Ranged, at the user's option. The Basic Gear used for these Techniques don't cost anything during character creation, but they take up an inventory slot, and replacements may cost Coins. Ammunition isn't tracked; if a Tool is represented by a large number of disposable equipment (such as throwing weapons), one Tool is enough to represent the user's supply. Built-In Tools (used by Constructs) are functionally the same as Tools, but are built into the user's body. They still take up an inventory slot. Tutor (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Cheer/Magic] [X] . Choose up to [X] of this Technique's Traits; multiple instances of a Technique (e.g. Lingering x2) must be selected individually (requiring you to select both instances of Lingering). Those Traits have no effect on this Technique, and the target instead becomes Tutored in their use for [X] turns; for each additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Depending on the exact nature of the Traits being Tutored and how the tutelage is carried out, you may also be Disarmed when trying to use relevant Techniques for the same duration (e.g. if you Tutor someone in Tool by handing them your equipment). If the Tutored Traits are negative, any FP that would be saved by them instead becomes a positive value (e.g. Unwieldy goes from -2 FP to +2 FP). If this Secondary Check uses Cheer, you must include at least one positive Trait, and if it uses Bully, you can't include any positive Traits. Underfoot (+2 FP) [Approach] [Target] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. This Technique comes from the ground, affecting all targets in the target group in contact with the ground, besides the user. As a result, it also functions as the Indirect Trait and, if it has no other element, has Element (Earth, Quake). Variant (+1 FP) [X - Cap 2] . You may choose a different skill to use for either your Primary or Secondary check for this Technique. Weaken (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target's abilities are Weakened for [X] turns – the exact abilities affected by the Weakening are decided when this Trait is chosen. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. ",

    "content": "Blowback (-4 FP) . After finishing this attack, the user loses HP equal to half this attack's Raw Damage. If this attack would affect the target with a Secondary Check, the user is affected as well, though they can resist with Steady as normal. The user's HP loss can't be resisted in any way (including Defense, Safe or Secure) and ignores the user's Weaknesses, Resistances or Immunities. The Technique must deal damage, and this Trait cannot be combined with Self. Commitment (-2 FP) [X - Cap 2] . Choose Primary Check or Secondary Check: . | Primary: This Technique's Primary Check fails unless its maximum possible effectiveness is achieved, and no higher roll is possible. Can't be combined with Traits that have no functional maximum (e.g. Repeat, Sequential), or Techniques without a useable reduced state (e.g. 0 Power). | Secondary: This Technique's Secondary Check only works if the maximum possible result is achieved. You can't combine this effect with a Secondary Check that only has one potential outcome, (e.g. Nice! with no benefits for a Good! result), or a Team effect which has no additional benefit for extra successes. | . The Technique must have a Primary or a Secondary Check in order for Commitment to be applied to either. Conditional (-1 FP) [X] . Choose up to [X] of this Technique's distinct Positive Traits; they only function in specific circumstances (e.g. midair, underwater), or against specific targets (e.g. Goombas, sleeping targets). If the Trait has multiple instances, this condition applies to all instances of that trait, and the specific circumstances are defined for each Trait separately. Otherwise, the Technique continues to function. The circumstances don't need to be extremely rare but they can't be so common as to almost always be applicable for the user (e.g. \"enemies that can breathe\"). Can't be combined with Situational effects involving the same circumstance. Cooldown (-1 FP) [X - Cap 5] . This Technique can't be used again until [X] turns have passed, counting from the next turn. Delayed (-2 FP) [X - Cap 5] . This Technique doesn't take effect immediately, instead being executed [X] rounds after it was used as a free action at the end of the round. Targets are declared, FP is spent and checks are rolled when this Technique is first used. If the target is invalid when the Technique is executed, it either targets the same area (if a valid target has taken the initial target's place), or fails. Instead of swapping with their allies, if a targeted character would swap under their own power, they can move the targeted space for this Technique the same distance – and can even move it outside of their group to completely dodge it. Exhausting (-4 FP) [X] . The user can't take any more actions for [X] turns. They can still talk, move around (without changing position), take part in other characters' actions (such as Team Techniques and swapping with Coordination) and react freely. Fumble (-? FP) [Random] . This Technique has a rare chance to backfire. It contains a Fumble Slot of Technique Traits. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6; the Fumble Slot's Traits are suppressed, as long as you don't roll a 1. The Fumble Slot can contain any number of Technique Traits, with their FP cost calculated separately from your own Technique, including all of their negative Traits. The Fumble Slot can have any number of Traits, but its overall FP cost must be negative. The amount of FP Fumble takes off of your Technique is equal to 1/3 of the Fumble Slot's FP cost. Example: Fumbled Attack . A Hammer Bro swings with a devastating melee attack – but their hammer is so heavy, it has a 1 in 6 chance to Fumble! The Fumble Slot contains Harmless, and 6 instances of Penalty (Disarm (Tool)), which would normally save -9 FP. This cost is divided by 3, for -3 FP. When the Hammer Bro fumbles, they're unable to swing – and worse, they lose their grip on their hammer! . You can combine Lucky Hit with Fumble. If the Technique has both traits, roll the same die once for both effects. Harmless (-3 FP) [Strikes] . This Technique doesn't deal damage at all; it includes no Strikes, isn't affected by Attack and has no Primary Check, instead skipping to the Secondary Check (if applicable). Since it has no need to physically strike at the target, it can also include the Indirect Trait at the user's option for no added cost. This Trait can't be combined with Weak. Lacking (-1 FP) [X] . Choose one of this Technique's distinct Positive Traits; it needs [X] additional Grades of Success in order to function, and is inactive if that threshold isn't met. If that Trait has multiple instances, this Lacking effect applies to all instances of that trait. If you have multiple instances of Lacking targeting different traits, you can split the additional [X] Grades of Success between them freely. This Trait can't save more FP than the target Trait's total FP cost. This Trait can't be added if it would raise the minimum floor for the overall success of relevant checks. Example: Lacking Status . If a Technique had both Lingering x3 and Daze x2, you could add Lacking (Daze) to require a Good result or higher for Daze to function. You couldn't then add Lacking (Lingering), because then the Secondary Check would require a Good result at minimum. Others (-1 FP) [Target] . This Technique can only be used on one other willing target (e.g. allies), and not the user or their enemies. Penalty (-2 FP) [X - Cap 3] . Choose up to [X] negative Statuses when you add this Trait (e.g. Confused, Dazed, Disarmed, Disoriented, Lingering, Provoked, Stunned or Weakened). After this Technique resolves, you receive those Statuses with no opportunity to resist. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [XXXX], and their duration is unaffected by Shorten. If you choose a Status you have an Immunity to, this effect bypasses that Immunity. You can reduce this Status with Steady in later turns, as normal for any Status. Self (-? FP) [Target] . This Technique can only be used on the user. If this Technique has Counter or Harmless, this trait is worth -1 FP. Otherwise, this trait is worth -2 FP for each point of Power in this Technique (after applying other Traits), and the user can't bypass or otherwise resist its damage through Immunities, Resistances, Secure or any other effect. Shorten (-1 FP) [X] . The effects of this Technique last for [X] less turns, to a minimum of 1. This Trait can't be taken more than the maximum number of turns all of its effects can last. Side-Effect (-2 FP) [X - Cap 3] . Choose up to [X] positive Statuses when you add this Trait (e.g. Boosted, Hustled or Secure). Before this Technique resolves, regardless of its check result, all targeted enemies receive that Status. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [XXXX], their duration is unaffected by Shorten, and the Status Level can't exceed the maximum allowed for the Status (e.g. Secure can't go beyond Status Level 1). Any Status added with this Trait must be impactful and useful to a general enemy; Boost (Attack) would be fine for most cases, but something like Boost (Knowhow) would generally be too niche and require GM approval. Situational (-? FP) . Choose one: . | For -2 FP, this Technique can't be used while in a specific situation, such as while in a specific State or while using a Power-Up. | For -4 FP, this Technique can't be used at all outside of a specific situation, such as while underwater, while the target is at full health, or while in midair. | . In either case, the situation doesn't need to be extremely rare but it must be reasonably plausible for the user (e.g. a Goomba couldn't have \"while flipped over\"), and it can't be so common as to always be applicable (e.g. a Goomba couldn't have \"while able to breathe\"). Can't be combined with Conditional effects involving the same circumstances. Team (-2 FP) [Secondary - Coordination/Cheer] [X] . This Technique requires the user and [X] other allies to roll for this Technique's Secondary Check first, before the Primary Check is rolled; if any participant's roll fails to meet the Secondary Check's minimum requirements, the Technique fails. Otherwise, you can use the result of any other participant's Secondary Check in place of your Primary Check and/or your Secondary Check. If you replace your Primary Check in this way, don't roll for your own Primary Check. For the purposes of rewarding Exceptional Results and Exceptional Technique boosts, the user makes all decisions, but SP earned goes to the character who made the check, and only the checks used for the final Technique can earn SP. Unwieldy (-2 FP) [X] . This Technique requires [X] more Grades of Success to function; you can apply these additional requirements to either its Primary or Secondary checks freely. Weak (-2 FP) [X - Cap by Power] . This Technique has –[X] Power. This Trait cannot be combined with Harmless, and cannot reduce Power lower than 0. If you're confident you can hit your targets, Scaling and Strong combo well with Unwieldy to make your attacks much more powerful! Consider adding these traits on as you level up and get better at making checks. ",

Usually, all parties in battle are impacted by the Terrain, but it's possible through circumstance or Techniques for just a small area to be impacted.

I've tried to include as many fun ideas as possible, and keep closely to the original spirit of Paper Mario. Your players are bound to have all sorts of crazy ideas, either to solve problems in inventive new ways, to skirt around the limitations of their Techniques or to play wacky species not covered here. I strongly recommend you work together with them on that, to the extent that your game is comfortable with it. The Items, Species, Techniques and Traits presented in this book are just a starting point. Don't be afraid to draft new content for your players, or design Techniques by hand. Creating an imaginative solution that suits your game and your players will always be better than forcing players into a mould they're not interested in. The rest of this book is devoted to resources for you to use at your own table, and suggestions for how to tweak the provided rules for your players.

    "content": "A critical distinction between Paper Story and other systems you might have played is that Non-Player Characters (NPC's) don't follow any pre-defined rules – they just kind of work. NPC's only have very basic stats – HP and Defense is usually the only thing you need to consider, as well as how they attack the players (if they do). Essentially, NPC actions automatically succeed, and the players are the ones that have to respond to those actions. They represent the flow of the narrative for your game, so you just have to direct them as you see fit. They don't make attack checks, they don't contest player's actions, and they don't waste your time. In a combat scenario, all you need for an NPC is to track their key stats and the outcome of their attacks – which is usually just the number of strikes, the damage dealt and any Statuses they can dish out. You can give them FP, too, if you want the players to wear them down over time; usually though I'd recommend just spacing out their best attacks by a turn or two. If their FP total comes up (such as through a Point Swap), it's rare enough that it's easier to just come up with something on the fly. By design, all of this is simple enough to mock up on the spot, but it can be really helpful to look at how the games have used enemies in battles and build off of that. If an NPC really poses a challenge (out-swimming a Cheep Cheep, or Bullying a mighty dragon), your players still make their rolls as normal, but you might want to warn them they'll need more Grades of Success. Boss fights in particular can get away with some resistance to Statuses. If you're not familiar with this style of play it can take some getting used to – I highly recommend Dungeon World and other Powered By The Apocalypse systems if you're interested in seeing that concept taken further, as it was a big inspiration for this system.

    "title": "Star Power Techniques",
    "content": "In a long-form campaign, players may acquire certain powers that rely on Star Power to function, from artifacts, powerful beings or whatever else fits within your campaign. With these boons comes an increase in maximum SP, improving SP limits by 10 with each ability. In the context of Paper Story, these are basically just Techniques which cost SP instead of FP, as defined by the GM. As these are more potent than regular Techniques and run on a less reliable power source, GM's are encouraged to set SP costs as they see fit, and homebrew effects as necessary. Some examples are provided below based on the existing games, to be taken as suggestions only. Traits used are provided as a reference, showing how they could potentially be designed as Techniques, and the relative power level when translated into FP. Simple rolls are generally assumed to succeed, however for debilitating Statuses and other effects where variance is useful, feel free to request relevant checks. Magic, Bully, Cheer and Perform are all useful skills to call in these circumstances, though that will vary based on the Technique and source of their power. Equivalent FP costs assume the Technique operates at 1 Power and automatically achieve their full potential. When used in-game it's recommended that these Techniques don't rely on the user's Power or Attack; usually, they just have set damage values. Keep in mind these are rough estimates, as many Star Power Techniques don't fit neatly into Paper Story's mechanics – generally, it's better for the GM to design Star Power Techniques from scratch, working as they see fit. Refresh Eldstar . 10 SP . Restore all allies' HP and FP by 5, and cures all status conditions. Affects the user, too. Allies, Hearty x3, Flowery x3, Dismiss, Harmless Equivalent: 11 FP . Lullaby Mamar . 10 SP . Attempts to put all targets outside the user's group to sleep, Dazing them. The user makes a Magic or Cheer check; for each Grade of Success, targets are Dazed (5) for 1 turn, to a maximum of 5 turns. All, Safe, Daze x5, Harmless Equivalent: 7 FP . Star Storm Skolar . 20 SP . Deals 7 Piercing Star DMG to all targets outside the user's group. All, Safe, Strong x3, Piercing, Element (Star) Equivalent: 15 FP . Chill Out Muskular . 20 SP . Reduces the Attack of all targets outside the user's group by -3, for 3 turns. All, Safe, Weaken (Attack) x3, Harmless Equivalent: 7 FP . Smooch Misstar . 30 SP . Restores the user's HP by 20. Hearty x10, Harmless, Self Equivalent: 6 FP . Time Out Klevar . 20 SP . Attempts to freeze all targets outside the user's group in time, Stunning them at Status Level 5. The user makes a Magic or Cheer check; for each Grade of Success, targets are completely Stunned (6) for a turn, to a maximum of 5 turns. All, Safe, Stun x5 (Stronger Variant), Harmless Equivalent: 12 FP . Up &amp; Away Kalmar . 20 SP . Attempts to remove all targets outside the user's group from battle, sending them to the stars. The user makes a Magic or Cheer check; for each Grade of Success, they can remove a target with 5 HP or less from the battle. Multiple Grades of Success can be bundled together to remove targets with more than 5 HP. e.g. Two Grades of Success could remove two targets with 5 HP, or one target with 10 HP. All, Safe, Custom Banish Effect, Harmless Equivalent: ? FP . Star Beam Star Haven . 10 SP . The user can remove all positive conditions (e.g. Boost, Counter, Secure) and magic effects (e.g. Invisibility, Flight) from all combatants in the target group. Group, Harmless, Dismiss Equivalent: 3 FP . ",

    "title": "Simplified Rules",
    "content": "While the core rules for skill checks and Grades of Success are meant to be lightweight, you might find the depth of options presented for Species and Techniques to be overwhelming. That's okay! These are just meant to be a starting point for players. If you'd prefer to take things back a step, and your table is okay with it, you can break these down into simpler concepts for them. | To make a Simple Species, give them +2 to their Stats (in any combination), and 3 relevant Skill Specialisations. They start play with 1 Power and 0 Defense. That's all you need for a playable species with its own distinct flair, but if you want to go further, their qualities can be summed up as Quirks. | Quirks can be Big or Small, and either Positive or Negative. Big Quirks are twice as valuable as Small Quirks; think of Small Quirks as +/- 1, and Big Quirks as +/- 2. The final species should have a total Quirk value of (roughly) 0. | Big Quirks impact important stats like Power or Defense, or provide significant advantages, like Immunity or Weakness to certain attacks. | Small Quirks are more situational advantages and flaws, like points in Resistance, Flight or the Aquatic Trait. | . | To make a Simple Technique, start from a simple damage-dealing attack using Coordination. It deals up to the character's Power in damage with no successes, and up to twice that with a Nice result. To expand on that, you can summarise all of a Technique's effects as Quirks. | Like with Species, Quirks can be Big or Small, and either Positive or Negative. Big Quirks are twice as valuable as Small Quirks; think of Small Quirks as +/- 1, and Big Quirks as +/- 2. The final FP cost of the Technique should be about 2 less than its total Quirk value, but players should work with the GM to find a value that's right for their Technique. | Big Quirks represent the bulk of the action, like a Status you want to inflict, the Technique's targets, the required Grades, extra damage you want to deal, or (as a negative) even the inability to deal damage. | Small Quirks represent the little things, like requirements to use the Technique, the type of damage it deals or the HP it recovers. | . | . Keep in mind though that these simplified systems aren't balanced the same way as regular Species or Techniques, so it's recommended to only use them sparingly. You shouldn't need more than a few Quirks for anything. ",

    "title": "Travel Time",
    "content": "Generally, navigating around the world can be handled on a scene-by-scene basis, with the GM describing the players' surroundings and the players asking clarifying questions or making actions to engage with the world. However, sometimes you want to move the exploration along a bit, or have the players carry out some exciting acrobatic feats deserving of a Mario game. These rules can be used to quickly navigate an area, abstracting a dungeon, \"level\" or other explorable area into a couple of rolls. Make sure you still describe their actions and the area they're exploring! Otherwise it's easy to feel like you're just making dice rolls. | All players make an Athletics check (or otherwise appropriate skill) on their own, representing their general ability to navigate the terrain. | With enough Grades of Success, they can make it through without difficulty. The exact amount needed would vary depending on the area they're exploring, but usually a Great result is a good start. | . | If players fail this check, they suffer some kind of complication; but ultimately, they should still make progress. | Depending on the area they're in and the pacing of the game, you might want to make this something small (like some damage, or dropping some Coins), but occasionally a big distraction can be fun – just keep in mind that anything too big is going to detract from the players that did succeed. | Usually this should require the players make another skill check (e.g. Steady to resist some hazard), make a choice, or engage in battle. Although if they almost succeeded, or it's only a minor complication, it's fine to just describe it and move along. | . | If players succeeded earlier, they can optionally make another check for some kind of reward, or to help players who are struggling. | This can be up to the player, but usually as the GM you'll want to present them with a choice between two things to do, or two routes they can go down. | The easiest thing to ask for here is a Notice check, giving players a chance to find Items or Coins. This is a good way to get small things to players that they might not have otherwise considered, like Mushrooms or crafting materials. | Another fun option can be Perform, giving players a chance to revel in their athleticism. This is basically an Appeal for SP. | Alternate, more difficult, paths could use Athletics, Coordination or Steady to traverse safely. These paths can lead to more rewards, bypass some enemies, or get to the end faster. | . | . Usually, that's enough to get through an area. But if players are lagging behind, or the area is particularly long or dangerous, you can consider asking for another check to navigate the area. ",

    "title": "Partner System",
    "content": "As an alternative to standard Paper Story, you may want to create a diverse cast of partners to assist one major character, much like in the N64 original. This may better suit a campaign where players control a variety of characters, or where many players may drop in and out, centred around one main figure. In the Partner System, in addition to ordinary characters (like Mario), there are simplified partner characters. Whenever a partner takes any amount of damage from an enemy, they act as if KO'd and sit out of the fight; unlike ordinary status effects, this cannot be reduced by Steady. Instead, at the start of each turn they restore 1 HP, and become active again when they're fully healed. If for whatever reason a partner takes enough damage to reduce their HP to 0, then as normal, they are rendered completely inactive, can't take any further actions and don't passively heal. Partners can't be attacked while in this state, though they may still take damage through other effects. While in this state, partners can take certain actions to help them recover faster. This still counts as their action for the turn. | Using Items on themselves. | Making Heal checks on themselves. | Getting a Second Wind with their SP. | . Under this system, a number of Badges change when used by partners, as noted on the following page. This system works well for a large number of partners, which may make things take longer and unbalance games. If this is a concern, you may want to restrict combat actions to one partner at a time (as in the games), or have a large group of partners in a loosely assembled formation behind their leader. In any case, it's not as flexible as standard play, and is only recommended for games focused on a central protagonist. Power Rush BadgeAttackPartner Behavior • 1 BP • 50 Coins . While suffering from damage, and for the next turn after recovering from damage, you have +2 Attack. Mega Rush BadgeAttackPartner Behavior • 1 BP • 50 Coins . While you have only 1 HP, and for the next turn after recovering from damage that reduced you to 1 HP, you have +5 Attack. HP Drain BadgeAttackPartner Behavior • 1 BP • 100 Coins . -1 Attack. When your attacks deal damage, you can restore 1 HP for yourself or an ally. Last Stand BadgeDefensePartner Behavior • 1 BP • 50 Coins . You can still act until you lose 6 or more HP. Close Call BadgeDefensePartner Behavior • 1 BP • 100 Coins . While suffering from damage, you can attempt to Dodge before you Block, and you have +1d6 to Dodge checks. Heart Finder BadgeBoonPartner Behavior • 3 BP • 100 Coins . When an ally takes damage, you can make a Heal check targeting them as a free action. ",

    "content": "Sometimes you want to take the kid's gloves off, and delve into some darker themes. It's a vibe that doesn't really align with the Mario world, so it's largely absent from Paper Story, but it's a fair enough thought process. The original games certainly dance a thin line here; death and other adult themes are certainly present in this world, if not a focal point, and sometimes you need to highlight the danger your players are in. Sometimes, being KO'd in the field of battle is a very real possibility – you should make sure players understand the risks, and try not to be too flippant with it. It's probably okay for a lengthy poison to drain someone's life away, or a particularly devastating attack to end their game – not so much a Goomba's headbonk. Even in these cases, it's best not to be too graphic, and let players form their own mental pictures to the level they're comfortable with. It's enough to explain that the dragon has eaten someone whole – you don't need to go into grisly detail about how it's playing out. And of course, the most important thing is to set the expectation with your players. As long as everyone knows what they're signing up for, it can providea different kind of fun. ",
