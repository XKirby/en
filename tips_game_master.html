I've tried to include as many fun ideas as possible, and keep closely to the original spirit of <em class="italic">Paper Mario</em>.</p> <p>Your players are bound to have all sorts of crazy ideas, either to solve problems in inventive new ways, to skirt around the limitations of their Techniques or to play wacky species not covered here.<br> I strongly recommend you work together with them on that, to the extent that your game is comfortable with it.<br> The Items, Species, Techniques and Traits presented in this book are just a starting point. Don't be afraid to draft new content for your players, or design Techniques by hand. Creating an imaginative solution that suits your game and your players will always be better than forcing players into a mould they're not interested in.</p> <p>The rest of this book is devoted to resources for you to use at your own table, and suggestions for how to tweak the provided rules for your players.</p> <p>I hope this helps you to wrap your head around the game. Thanks again for reading. These are very special games, and I hope you enjoy translating them to your tabletop.</p> <h2 id="npc-inaction"> <a href="#npc-inaction" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> NPC Inaction </h2> <p>A critical distinction between Paper Story and other systems you might have played is that Non-Player Characters (NPC's) don't follow any pre-defined rules – they just kind of work.<br> NPC's only have very basic stats – <em class="heart-color">HP</em> and Defense is usually the only thing you need to consider, as well as how they attack the players (if they do).</p> <p>Essentially, NPC actions automatically succeed, and the players are the ones that have to respond to those actions. They represent the flow of the narrative for your game, so you just have to direct them as you see fit.<br> They don't make attack checks, they don't contest player's actions, and they don't waste your time.<br> In a combat scenario, all you need for an NPC is to track their key stats and the outcome of their attacks – which is usually just the number of strikes, the damage dealt and any Statuses they can dish out.<br> You can give them <em class="spirit-color">FP</em>, too, if you want the players to wear them down over time; usually though I'd recommend just spacing out their best attacks by a turn or two. If their <em class="spirit-color">FP</em> total comes up (such as through a Point Swap), it's rare enough that it's easier to just come up with something on the fly.<br> By design, all of this is simple enough to mock up on the spot, but it can be really helpful to look at how the games have used enemies in battles and build off of that.</p> <p>If an NPC really poses a challenge (out-swimming a Cheep Cheep, or <em class="courage-color">Bullying</em> a mighty dragon), your players still make their rolls as normal, but you might want to warn them they'll need more Grades of Success. Boss fights in particular can get away with some resistance to Statuses.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with this style of play it can take some getting used to – I highly recommend <em class="italic">Dungeon World</em> and other <em class="italic">Powered By The Apocalypse</em> systems if you're interested in seeing that concept taken further, as it was a big inspiration for this system.</p> <h2 id="npc-action"> <a href="#npc-action" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> NPC Action </h2> <p>Of course, if you prefer you can crunch out NPC stat blocks, giving them skills and techniques like a player would have. In this case you would either have their skills set the target number of Grades of Success players need to succeed, or have them actively oppose the players with rolls of their own.</p> <p>The important thing to remember is this will make the players' lives a lot harder, as all of their actions will take more effort and the outcomes will be less certain. So it's important to be clear with your players if you take this option.</p> <h2 id="star-power-techniques"> <a href="#star-power-techniques" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Star Power Techniques </h2> <p>In a long-form campaign, players may acquire certain powers that rely on Star Power to function, from artifacts, powerful beings or whatever else fits within your campaign. With these boons comes an increase in <em class="courage-color">maximum SP</em>, improving <em class="courage-color">SP</em> limits by 10 with each ability.</p> <p>In the context of Paper Story, these are basically just Techniques which cost <em class="courage-color">SP</em> instead of <em class="spirit-color">FP</em>, as defined by the GM. As these are more potent than regular Techniques and run on a less reliable power source, GM's are encouraged to set <em class="courage-color">SP</em> costs as they see fit, and homebrew effects as necessary.</p> <p>Some examples are provided below based on the existing games, to be taken as suggestions only. Traits used are provided as a reference, showing how they could potentially be designed as Techniques, and the relative power level when translated into <em class="spirit-color">FP</em>.<br> Simple rolls are generally assumed to succeed, however for debilitating Statuses and other effects where variance is useful, feel free to request relevant checks. <em class="spirit-color">Magic</em>, <em class="courage-color">Bully</em>, <em class="courage-color">Cheer</em> and <em class="courage-color">Perform</em> are all useful skills to call in these circumstances, though that will vary based on the Technique and source of their power.</p> <p>Equivalent <em class="spirit-color">FP</em> costs assume the Technique operates at 1 Power and automatically achieve their full potential.<br> When used in-game it's recommended that these Techniques don't rely on the user's Power or Attack; usually, they just have set damage values.<br> Keep in mind these are rough estimates, as many Star Power Techniques don't fit neatly into Paper Story's mechanics – generally, it's better for the GM to design Star Power Techniques from scratch, working as they see fit.</p> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/stars/eldstar.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Refresh</em><br> <em class="italic">Eldstar</em></p> <p><em class="courage-color">10 SP</em></p> <p>Restore all allies' <em class="heart-color">HP</em> and <em class="spirit-color">FP</em> by 5, and cures all status conditions.

These are just meant to be a starting point for players. If you'd prefer to take things back a step, and your table is okay with it, you can break these down into simpler concepts for them.</p> <ul> <li>To make a Simple Species, give them +2 to their Stats (in any combination), and 3 relevant Skill Specialisations.<br> They start play with 1 Power and 0 Defense.<br> That's all you need for a playable species with its own distinct flair, but if you want to go further, their qualities can be summed up as Quirks. <ul> <li>Quirks can be Big or Small, and either Positive or Negative.<br> Big Quirks are twice as valuable as Small Quirks; think of Small Quirks as +/- 1, and Big Quirks as +/- 2. The final species should have a total Quirk value of (roughly) 0.</li> <li>Big Quirks impact important stats like Power or Defense, or provide significant advantages, like Immunity or Weakness to certain attacks.</li> <li>Small Quirks are more situational advantages and flaws, like points in Resistance, Flight or the Aquatic Trait.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To make a Simple Technique, start from a simple damage-dealing attack using <em class="heart-color">Coordination</em>. It deals up to the character's Power in damage with no successes, and up to twice that with a Nice result.<br> To expand on that, you can summarise all of a Technique's effects as Quirks. <ul> <li>Like with Species, Quirks can be Big or Small, and either Positive or Negative.<br> Big Quirks are twice as valuable as Small Quirks; think of Small Quirks as +/- 1, and Big Quirks as +/- 2.<br> The final <em class="spirit-cost">FP cost</em> of the Technique should be about 2 less than its total Quirk value, but players should work with the GM to find a value that's right for their Technique.</li> <li>Big Quirks represent the bulk of the action, like a Status you want to inflict, the Technique's targets, the required Grades, extra damage you want to deal, or (as a negative) even the inability to deal damage.</li> <li>Small Quirks represent the little things, like requirements to use the Technique, the type of damage it deals or the <em class="heart-color">HP</em> it recovers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Keep in mind though that these simplified systems aren't balanced the same way as regular Species or Techniques, so it's recommended to only use them sparingly. You shouldn't need more than a few Quirks for anything.</p> <h2 id="travel-time"> <a href="#travel-time" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Travel Time </h2> <p>Generally, navigating around the world can be handled on a scene-by-scene basis, with the GM describing the players' surroundings and the players asking clarifying questions or making actions to engage with the world.<br> However, sometimes you want to move the exploration along a bit, or have the players carry out some exciting acrobatic feats deserving of a Mario game.<br> These rules can be used to quickly navigate an area, abstracting a dungeon, "level" or other explorable area into a couple of rolls.<br> Make sure you still describe their actions and the area they're exploring!<br> Otherwise it's easy to feel like you're just making dice rolls.</p> <ul> <li>All players make an <em class="heart-color">Athletics</em> check (or otherwise appropriate skill) on their own, representing their general ability to navigate the terrain. <ul> <li>With enough Grades of Success, they can make it through without difficulty. The exact amount needed would vary depending on the area they're exploring, but usually a <em class="great-color">Great</em> result is a good start.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If players <em class="underlined">fail</em> this check, they suffer some kind of complication; but ultimately, they should still make progress. <ul> <li>Depending on the area they're in and the pacing of the game, you might want to make this something small (like some damage, or dropping some Coins), but occasionally a big distraction can be fun – just keep in mind that anything too big is going to detract from the players that did succeed.</li> <li>Usually this should require the players make another skill check (e.g. <em class="courage-color">Steady</em> to resist some hazard), make a choice, or engage in battle. Although if they almost succeeded, or it's only a minor complication, it's fine to just describe it and move along.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If players succeeded earlier, they can optionally make another check for some kind of reward, or to help players who are struggling. <ul> <li>This can be up to the player, but usually as the GM you'll want to present them with a choice between two things to do, or two routes they can go down.</li> <li>The easiest thing to ask for here is a <em class="spirit-color">Notice</em> check, giving players a chance to find Items or Coins. This is a good way to get small things to players that they might not have otherwise considered, like Mushrooms or crafting materials.</li> <li>Another fun option can be <em class="courage-color">Perform</em>, giving players a chance to revel in their athleticism. This is basically an Appeal for <em class="courage-color">SP</em>.</li> <li>Alternate, more difficult, paths could use <em class="heart-color">Athletics</em>, <em class="heart-color">Coordination</em> or <em class="courage-color">Steady</em> to traverse safely. These paths can lead to more rewards, bypass some enemies, or get to the end faster.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Usually, that's enough to get through an area. But if players are lagging behind, or the area is particularly long or dangerous, you can consider asking for another check to navigate the area.</p> <h2 id="partner-system"> <a href="#partner-system" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Partner System </h2> <p>As an alternative to standard Paper Story, you may want to create a diverse cast of partners to assist one major character, much like in the N64 original.<br> This may better suit a campaign where players control a variety of characters, or where many players may drop in and out, centred around one main figure.</p> <p>In the Partner System, in addition to ordinary characters (like Mario), there are simplified partner characters.<br> Whenever a partner takes any amount of damage from an enemy, they act as if KO'd and sit out of the fight; unlike ordinary status effects, this cannot be reduced by <em class="courage-color">Steady</em>.<br> Instead, at the start of each turn they restore <em class="heart-color">1 HP</em>, and become active again when they're fully healed.<br> If for whatever reason a partner takes enough damage to reduce their HP to 0, then as normal, they are rendered completely inactive, can't take any further actions and don't passively heal.<br> Partners can't be attacked while in this state, though they may still take damage through other effects.</p> <p>While in this state, partners can take certain actions to help them recover faster. This still counts as their action for the turn.</p> <ul> <li>Using Items on themselves.</li> <li>Making <em class="heart-color">Heal</em> checks on themselves.</li> <li>Getting a <a href="https://paperstoryttrpg.github.io/en/star_power#second-wind">Second Wind</a> with their <em class="courage-color">SP</em>.</li> </ul> <p>Under this system, a number of Badges change when used by partners, as noted on the following page.</p> <p>This system works well for a large number of partners, which may make things take longer and unbalance games. If this is a concern, you may want to restrict combat actions to one partner at a time (as in the games), or have a large group of partners in a loosely assembled formation behind their leader.</p> <p>In any case, it's not as flexible as standard play, and is only recommended for games focused on a central protagonist.</p> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/powerrush.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Power Rush</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label attack-badge header-font">Attack</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 1 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 50 Coins</p> <p>While suffering from damage, and for the next turn after recovering from damage, you have +2 Attack.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/megarush.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Mega Rush</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label attack-badge header-font">Attack</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 1 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 50 Coins</p> <p>While you have only <em class="heart-color">1 HP</em>, and for the next turn after recovering from damage that reduced you to <em class="heart-color">1 HP</em>, you have +5 Attack.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/hpdrain.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">HP Drain</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label attack-badge header-font">Attack</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 1 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 100 Coins</p> <p>-1 Attack.<br> When your attacks deal damage, you can restore <em class="heart-color">1 HP</em> for yourself or an ally.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/laststand.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Last Stand</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label defense-badge header-font">Defense</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 1 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 50 Coins</p> <p>You can still act until you lose <em class="heart-color">6 or more HP</em>.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/closecall.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Close Call</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label defense-badge header-font">Defense</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 1 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 100 Coins</p> <p>While suffering from damage, you can attempt to <em class="spirit-color">Dodge</em> before you <em class="heart-color">Block</em>, and you have +1d6 to <em class="spirit-color">Dodge</em> checks.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote class="item-callout item-left"> <p><img src="assets/images/badges/heartfinder.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="item-inner-callout"> <p><em class="fs-6 header-font">Heart Finder</em><br> <em class="label item header-font">Badge</em><em class="label boon-badge header-font">Boon</em><em class="label item header-font">Partner Behavior</em><br> <img src="assets/images/icons/badgepoint-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 3 BP <img src="assets/images/icons/coin-small.png" alt="" class="inline-icon"> • 100 Coins</p> <p>When an ally takes damage, you can make a <em class="heart-color">Heal</em> check targeting them as a free action.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <h2 id="true-and-honest-paper-mario"> <a href="#true-and-honest-paper-mario" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> True and Honest Paper Mario </h2> <p>Paper Story adds a lot of options that aren't covered in the original games.<br> And you might feel some kind of way about that. That's fair! Sometimes I feel like elements are a bit too much, too.<br> But the important thing is that you can pick and choose what works for you and your group. Whether that's some of the new Badges, the Power-Up system or entire Technique Traits, feel free to split off the parts that you don't want to deal with.<br> Always remember; the GM gets the final say.</p> <h2 id="darker-and-edgier"> <a href="#darker-and-edgier" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Darker and Edgier </h2> <p>Sometimes you want to take the kid's gloves off, and delve into some darker themes. It's a vibe that doesn't really align with the Mario world, so it's largely absent from Paper Story, but it's a fair enough thought process.<br> The original games certainly dance a thin line here; death and other adult themes are certainly <em class="italic">present</em> in this world, if not a focal point, and sometimes you need to highlight the danger your players are in.<br> Sometimes, being KO'd in the field of battle is a very real possibility – you should make sure players understand the risks, and try not to be too flippant with it. It's probably okay for a lengthy poison to drain someone's life away, or a particularly devastating attack to end their game – not so much a Goomba's headbonk.<br> Even in these cases, it's best not to be too graphic, and let players form their own mental pictures to the level they're comfortable with. It's enough to explain that the dragon has eaten someone whole – you don't need to go into grisly detail about <em class="italic">how</em> it's playing out.<br> And of course, the most important thing is to set the expectation with your players. As long as everyone knows what they're signing up for, it can providea different kind of fun.</p> <hr> <footer> <!-- {%- if page.contributors.size > 0 -%} <ul class="contributor-list"> <li class="contributor-list-item"><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributor/">Contributors</a>:</li> {% for contributor in page.contributors %} <li class="contributor-list-item">#{% include contributors/contributor_link.html contributor=contributor %}</li> {% endfor %} {%- assign contributor = nil %} </ul> {%- endif -%} --> <p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-000 mb-0">This is a mirror of Paper Story's ruleset and is based on the publicly available PDFs of it.
