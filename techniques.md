Techniques are the myriad ways a character acts in combat, most often by attacking. Mostly characters get by with their Innate Techniques, which they learn over time, but they can access even more Techniques through [Gear]({{ "/inventory#gear" | absolute_url }}), [Badges]({{ "/inventory#badges" | absolute_url }}), *[Magic]({{ "/spirit_skills#magic" | absolute_url }})*{: .spirit-color }, and even *[Star Power]({{ "/star_power" | absolute_url }})*{: .courage-color }!

By default, all Techniques start from the same template:

{: .specie-inner-callout }
> *Basic Attack*{: .header-font } (*0 FP*{: .spirit-color })  
*Coordination*{: .heart-color }:  
Auto: [Power] DMG  
*Nice!*{: .nice-color }: [2 x Power] DMG  
*(No Traits)*{: .italic }
>

Techniques require the user to pass a Primary Check in order to deal damage, which defaults to their *Coordination*{: .heart-color }. The results vary depending on their overall success.

As in the above example, Techniques can still function with no Grades of Success, but improve with better results – though this threshold for success can be increased, making it harder to hit the minimum and maximum results.

If a Technique doesn't earn enough Grades to achieve any result, though, it fails outright!

## Damage Calculation

Whenever a Primary Check would deal damage as part of a Strike, each Strike is modified by the user's Attack to get the Raw Damage.  
Then, that damage value is reduced by the defender's Defense and any applicable Resistances they have, and that amount of damage is taken from the target's *HP*{: .heart-color }.

Importantly, your Attack can be negative too! In this case, the Attack value is taken out of the Raw Damage, and may reduce it right down to 0!

## Strikes

A Technique can divide its potential damage up into any number of strikes.

{: .content-callout }
> ### Single-Strike  
> Single-Strike attacks can hit one target solidly, dealing [Power] in DMG at a minimum, or [2 x Power] with an additional Grade of Success.  
> Single-Strike attacks hit with more force up-front, so regardless of the user's Power, a maximum result always deals at least 1 raw damage. Better yet, if they score a maximum result and *only*{: .underlined } have one target, they treat the user's positive Attack modifiers as doubled!

{: .content-callout }
> ### Multi-Strike  
> Multi-Strike attacks split some of the force up between their hits, dealing a portion of the attack's damage potential with each hit; as a general rule, each strike should deal no more than [Power] in damage.  
> They strike once if successful, then can make one more strike for each additional Grade of Success earned, but the total base damage of the split strikes can't be more than [2 x Power].

Taking damage at any point during an attack (such as from a Contact Trait) interrupts and cancels the Technique, but doesn't prevent the strike's damage.

## Technique Traits

When defining your Techniques you have a wide variety of Traits to modify them with, which either increase or decrease the Technique's final *FP*{: .spirit-color } cost. If this reduces your *FP*{: .spirit-color } cost to 0 or less, the Technique doesn't cost any *FP*{: .spirit-color }.

Tech Defaults are especially useful here – you can add on one of your available Tech Default sets without modifying the *FP*{: .spirit-color } cost at all!  
Any Optional Tech Defaults which would apply can be added on as well without *FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
Required Tech Defaults *must*{: .underlined } be added where they would apply, and don't modify *FP*{: .spirit-color }.

Some Traits can be taken multiple times, layering together to enhance their effects. If two instances of the same Trait have different qualities (e.g. different elements, or targeted stats), count them as separate Traits.  
While you can stack as many Traits on a Technique as you please, there are limits to how much *FP*{: .spirit-color } you can save with negative Traits. You can only save *FP*{: .spirit-color } from 3 Traits at a time, plus one more Trait for every 2 of your levels.  
Any other negative Traits you add contribute to the overall Technique's effect, but don't modify *FP*{: .spirit-color } at all.

{: .example-callout}
> *Example: Negative Traits*{: .header-font }
>
> A level 1 Buzzy Beetle wants to begin play with a powerful *0 FP*{: .spirit-color } attack.
> They could add Strong for *2 FP*{: .spirit-color }, Overrun for *3 FP*{: .spirit-color }, and Divider for *3 FP*{: .spirit-color }, allowing them to cleave through a group of foes and break their formation apart. *8 FP*{: .spirit-color } is a lot to swallow, though. They can use up to 3 negative Traits to try and mitigate this cost.
> After much deliberation, they decide on Exhausting (*-4 FP*{: .spirit-color }), Penalty (*-2 FP*{: .spirit-color }), and Unwieldy (*-2 FP*{: .spirit-color }), giving them an all-or-nothing attack that's difficult to execute, and leaves them Dazed afterwards.
> They could add more negative Traits if they really wanted, but they wouldn't be able to save any more *FP*{: .spirit-color } from those Traits.

While you can describe a Technique in shorthand by referring to its Traits, in practice it's better to write out the full effect for your own reference – you may not always remember that a Piercing attack ignores Defense, or you may need to record how your Boost Technique works at different Grades of Success.

While the mechanics of building a Technique can be complicated, it's best to work within this system until you have a good idea of how Techniques work and what effects should cost.

If you find that you just can't make the Technique of your dreams, or your Technique isn't as effective as it should be, try discussing alternatives with your GM. You should consider this system to be a starting point for your own exciting ideas!

## Trait Effects

Some Traits have similar functions which are referred to in shorthand, explained here.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [X]
> 
> This Trait can be chosen multiple times to strengthen its effects; additional instances are treated as the same singular Trait, but with effects varying based on how many times the Trait has been taken, [X].  
> If there's a limit on how many times it can be taken, this is referred to as the Cap.  
> Note that multiple instances of these values are added together, not multiplied. If [X] is 3, then [XX] would be 6 (3 + 3), and [XXXX] would be 12 (3 + 3 + 3 + 3).

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Secondary]
> 
> After the Primary Check is resolved, as long as it didn't fail and there's still a valid target, some Techniques have follow-up effects which require a Secondary Check. The Skill required for this is defined by the Trait it's acquired from – if the Trait lists multiple Skills, choose one of them when you first define the Technique, and if the Technique has multiple [Secondary] Traits, choose one skill to represent all Secondary effects.  
> In any case, you only roll one Secondary Check for all relevant effects. If multiple targets would be affected, they all suffer the consequences of the same Secondary Check.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Approach]
> 
> This Trait modifies the way the user approaches their target(s). Generally, multiple [Approach] Traits can't be taken at once.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Target]
> 
> This Trait modifies the available targets for this Technique in some way. Generally, multiple [Target] Traits can't be taken at once.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Strikes]
> 
> This Trait modifies the way Strikes and damage are allocated in some way, making it fundamentally different from a Single-Strike or Multi-Strike Technique.  
> Generally, multiple Strikes Traits can't be taken at once.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Random]
> 
> This Trait features a random element. Multiple [Random] Traits can't be taken at once, unless otherwise specified.
> Random traits can only benefit from a number of negative traits equal to your character level.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Slots]
>
> This Trait includes Technique Slots, a smaller compartmentalised collection of Technique Traits. The exact number and nature of these slots depends on the Technique Trait.
> Unless otherwise specified, Technique Slots calculate their *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } separately from the overall Technique; rather than paying the *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } of the slot, it's used to determine the Technique's *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
> When calculated in this way, each individual Technique Slot can benefit from the same number of negative Traits that the Technique itself would, but can't benefit from any Tech Defaults.

## Positive Technique Traits

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Aerial*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Approach]
> 
> At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use *Athletics*{: .heart-color } instead.  
> The user flies through the air to deliver this attack, striking from above. This allows them to hit targets from anywhere in the fight, though they may struggle to hit targets who are blocked in some way (e.g. under a low ceiling).  
> If the user is flying when they make an Aerial attack, they can Plummet as they make this attack.  
> Plummeting attacks are made at +1 Power, but require one more Grade of Success on their Primary Check.  
> Regardless of the outcome, the user becomes grounded after a Plummeting attack.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *All*{: .positive-color} *(+3 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Target]
> 
> This Technique affects all available targets, be they friend or foe, besides the user. At the user's option this can also include the *Indirect*{: .positive-color } Trait for no additional cost.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Allies*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Target]
>
> This Technique affects all of the user's allies, but not themselves. At the user's option this can also include the *Indirect*{: .positive-color } Trait for no additional cost.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Alt-Cost*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color }
>
> Choose *HP*{: .heart-color }, *SP*{: .courage-color } or Coins:
> - *HP*{: .heart-color }: This Technique spends *HP*{: .heart-color } instead of *FP*{: .spirit-color }. It can't recover *HP*{: .heart-color }, and can't be combined with *Blowback*{: .negative-color } or varieties of *Self*{: .negative-color } that deal damage to the user.
> - *SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique spends *SP*{: .courage-color } instead of *FP*{: .spirit-color }. It can't recover *SP*{: .courage-color }, even through [Exceptional Results]({{ "/grades_of_success#exceptional-results" | absolute_url }}) (though [Exceptional Techniques]({{ "/exceptional_techniques" | absolute_url }}) are still possible).
> - Coins: This Technique spends 5 Coins for every *1 FP*{: .spirit-color } it would cost. It can't steal Coins through *Snatch*{: .positive-color }, and can't cover an equivalent cost of more than *10 FP*{: .spirit-color } (for 50 Coins).
>
> The effective *FP*{: .spirit-color } cost can't be reduced lower than *1 FP*{: .spirit-color } by negative Traits while using *Alt-Cost*{: .positive-color }.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Bestow*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Secondary - *Bully*{: .courage-color }/*Cheer*{: .courage-color }/*Knowhow*{: .spirit-color }/*Magic*{: .spirit-color }/*Trickery*{: .spirit-color }] [X]
>
> The target temporarily acquires a [Personal Trait]({{ "/personal_traits" | absolute_url }}) of your choice, as if they were *[Enchanted]({{ "/skills_in_detail#magic---spontaneous-spells" | absolute_url }})*, lasting for [X] turns. The exact Personal Traits added by this Trait are decided when this Trait is bought, and any special effects (such as an added Weakness) should be in line with similar effects.
> If the Trait requires an action or check to activate (such as to take flight with Fly), it uses your action, and the results of your Secondary Check.
> Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher.
> For every additional Grade of Success, increase those numerical values by 1, to a maximum of [X].
> The target must pay *FP costs*{: .spirit-color } for their Traits as normal.
> If this Technique doesn't have *Variant*{: .positive-color }, and it uses *Cheer*{: .courage-color } for its skill check, this effect can only be used to add positive Traits to allies (e.g. Fly).
> Otherwise, if it doesn't have *Variant*{: .positive-color }, and it uses *Bully*{: .courage-color } or *Trickery*{: .spirit-color } for its skill check, this effect can only be used on enemies to add negative Traits (e.g. Weakness).

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Boost*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Secondary - *Cheer*{: .courage-color }/*Heal*{: .heart-color}/*Magic*{: .spirit-color }] [X]
>
> The target's abilities are [Boosted]({{ "/statuses#boosted" | absolute_url }}) for [X] turns – the exact abilities affected by the Boost are decided when this Trait is bought.  
> For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X].  
> This Technique can also use the following skills for Secondary Checks, depending on the ability being Boosted:
> 
> - Attack: *Athletics*{: .heart-color } or *Coordination*{: .heart-color }
> - Defense: *Guard*{: .heart-color }
> - Dodge: *Trickery*{: .spirit-color }
> - Skill (e.g. *Steady*{: .courage-color }): The same Skill being Boosted
> 
> If this Boost Technique has an element, it also has the following effects depending on the ability Boosted:
> 
> - Attack: The target's attacks have the same element for the duration.
> - Defense: The target's Resist for that element is Boosted, too.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Burst*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Strikes] [Target] [X]
> 
> This attack bursts either side of its initial target, reaching to strike the next [X] additional targets in front of them and the next [X] additional targets behind them, regardless of their elevation.
> The first target takes damage equal to [Power]. Like with a Single-Strike Technique, earning an additional Grade of Success instead deals damage equal to [2 x Power] (or 1 damage, if the Technique has 0 Power).
> Each new strike in either direction deals 1 less raw damage than the last; this can't reduce the raw damage below 0, so as long as the first strike could deal damage, the rest will deal at least 1 raw damage.
> If it has no other element, the user can optionally give this Technique *Element (Blast)*{: .positive-color }.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Charm*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Secondary - *Magic*{: .spirit-color}/*Persuade*{: .courage-color }/*Trickery*{: .spirit-color }] [X]
>
> The target is [Charmed]({{ "/statuses#charmed" | absolute_url }}), causing them to be easily persuaded, for [X] turns.  
> For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X].
>
> {: .tip-callout }
> > *An enemy Charmed is an enemy you don't have to deal with, **and**{: .underlined } an asset to fight your enemies! Even outside of combat, Charm can be incredibly useful.* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)
> > {: .icon-right }
>

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Coin Toss*{: .positive-color} *(+? FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Random] [Slots]
> 
> This Technique has 2 different Technique Slots, each assigned either Heads or Tails.
>
> When you use this Technique, flip a coin. Only the Slot whose side comes up is active for this use of the Technique, and the other Slot's Traits are ignored.  
> The overall *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } Coin Toss adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following:
>
> - ½ of the highest positive *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } in both Coin Slots.
> - *+1 FP*{: .spirit-color } for each Trait included in the Coin Slot with the most Traits.
> - *-1 FP*{: .spirit-color } if one of the Coin Slots is empty.
> - If either Coin Slot has a negative *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }, include ½ of it in Coin Toss' *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
> 
> If after this Coin Toss would have a negative *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }, you can treat it as a negative Trait instead.
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Heads or Tails*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A gambling Shy Guy spins into a wild, uncontrolled kick!  
> > Essentially, they flip a coin; if it comes up Heads, they can add Strong to their kick! If it comes up Tails, though, they Exhaust themselves instead.  
> > With Heads, Strong would normally cost *2 FP*{: .spirit-color }, so they add ½ that for *+1 FP*{: .spirit-color } to the cost.  
> > With Tails, Exhausting would save *-4 FP*{: .spirit-color }; so they take ½ that away, for *-2 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
> > Both sides have the same number of Traits, so they add *+1 FP*{: .spirit-color } for 1 Trait.  
> > The gambler's kick is so risky, it works out to *0 FP*{: .spirit-color } overall!

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Counter*{: .positive-color} *(+3 FP)*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> This Technique's Primary Check defaults to either *Athletics*{: .heart-color } or *Steady*{: .courage-color }.
> Instead of the usual effect of this Technique, the target gains the qualities of this Technique (excluding *Counter*{: .positive-color }, [Approach] and [Target] traits) as a [Contact]({{ "/personal_traits#contact" | absolute_url }}) Trait, either through some direct hazard or a counter-attack from the original user.  
> This Contact Trait lasts for 1 turn for each Grade of Success.  
> When the Contact Trait is triggered, it automatically succeeds and targets the attacker (ignoring their own Contact traits) with the same number of Grades of Success as the original user's Primary Check.  
> Secondary Checks are made as required when their Contact trait is triggered; depending on the nature of the trait, either the target or the original user make the check.

{: .content-callout }

> 
> The target is [Disarmed]({{ "/statuses#disarmed" | absolute_url }}) for [X] turns, preventing them from using the targeted attack or Trait – the exact Traits (e.g. *Tool*{: .positive-color }) or manner of attack (e.g. jump attacks) affected by this status are decided when this Trait is chosen.  
> For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X].

> For each Grade of Success, the user can choose one of the target's Statuses, their current Power-Up or a temporary Terrain affecting them.
> - Statuses or Terrain: Reduce duration by -1 for each Grade of Success this Technique earned overall.
> - Power-Up: The target must try to hold onto their Power-Up, as if they took damage; their check requires an additional Grade of Success for each Grade of Success this Secondary Check earned overall.
> If this Technique doesn't have *Variant*{: .positive-color }, and it uses *Heal*{: .heart-color } for its skill check, this effect can only be used to remove negative effects from allies (e.g. Weaken, debilitating Terrain).
> Otherwise, if it doesn't have *Variant*{: .positive-color }, and it uses *Bully*{: .courage-color } or *Trickery*{: .spirit-color } for its skill check, this effect can only be used on enemies to remove positive effects (e.g. Boost, Power-Ups, enhancing Terrain).

> This Trait can't save more *FP*{: .spirit-color } than the target Trait's total *FP*{: .spirit-color } cost.

> After this Technique resolves, you receive those Statuses with no opportunity to resist. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [XXXX], and their duration is unaffected by *Shorten*{: .negative-color }.  
> If you choose a Status you have an Immunity to, this effect bypasses that Immunity.

> Before this Technique resolves, regardless of its check result, all targeted enemies receive that Status. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [XXXX], their duration is unaffected by *Shorten*{: .negative-color }, and the Status Level can't exceed the maximum allowed for the Status (e.g. Secure can't go beyond Status Level 1).  
> Any Status added with this Trait must be impactful and useful to a general enemy; Boost (Attack) would be fine for most cases, but something like Boost (*Knowhow*{: .spirit-color }) would generally be too niche and require GM approval.

> 
> In either case, the situation doesn't need to be extremely rare but it must be reasonably plausible for the user (e.g. a Goomba couldn't have "while flipped over"), and it can't be so common as to always be applicable (e.g. a Goomba couldn't have "while able to breathe").

> This Technique requires the user and [X] other allies to roll for this Technique's Secondary Check first, before the Primary Check is rolled; if any participant's roll fails to meet the Secondary Check's minimum requirements, the Technique fails.  
> Otherwise, you can use the result of any other participant's Secondary Check in place of your Primary Check and/or your Secondary Check.  
> If you replace your Primary Check in this way, don't roll for your own Primary Check.  
> For the purposes of rewarding Exceptional Results and Exceptional Technique boosts, the user makes all decisions, but *SP*{: .courage-color } earned goes to the character who made the check, and only the checks used for the final Technique can earn *SP*{: .courage-color }.
